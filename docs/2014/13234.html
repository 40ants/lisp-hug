                <h1>Subclassing capi:choice</h1>
                <pre>
I’m subclassing capi:choice, and everything is going quite well. The only issue I’m having is that none of the choice callbacks are firing (e.g. :selection-callback). If I have to fire these myself, that’s fine, but I don’t see a common way of firing them where :callback-type is taken into account properly.

Does anyone know how to do this?

Thanks! And Happy Holidays + New Year!

Jeff M.

Yeah, I've had the same problem for a long time, and I think I also posted this question on lisp-hug. Unfortunately, nothing useful have turned up so far.

Instead, I've been working around the problem by re-implementing the most common callback-types, :interface, :interface-data etc. I placed them in a generic function called call-callback, which I call from my subclasses.. This has worked well so far, but it would indeed be much nicer to be able to use the existing CAPI callback functionality!
