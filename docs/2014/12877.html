Hi,

Here is the announcement again, with the new name.

We have released CLAWS, our own work-stealing scheduler for LispWorks. This is joint work with Charlotte Herzeel. You can find the code and a readme with some explanation at https://github.com/pcostanza/claws

This scheduler is not quite the same as what Cilk does. We also have a scheduler that is closer to Cilk, which allows for executing the continuation of a sync on arbitrary worker threads. However, it is also harder to use - you basically have to convert your program into continuation-passing style - and in our experience, you donâ€™t get much better performance out of this in practice. CLAWS is much easier to use because you can code in direct style. If you are interested in the Cilk-like version anyway, please let us know.

Any other kind of feedback is also welcome.

Best,
Pascal
