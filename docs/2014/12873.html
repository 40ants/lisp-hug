Note: the problem below is specific to Mac (I can't test delivery on 
Windows).<br>
  <br>
It's taken me 3 days to find a workaround to this particular problem. 
I'm posting this here instead of to support in hopes that I don't 
understand something in Common Lisp and will learn. If no one has an 
answer for me I'll pass it along to support...<br>
  <br>
In my app, my main interface held the app preferences that were loaded 
on startup. You could think of it like this:<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">(define-interface app ()</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp; ((prefs :accessor app-prefs))</span><br
 style="font-family: monospace;">
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp; (:default-initargs</span><br 
style="font-family: monospace;">
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp; :create-callback 
'create-app))</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
  <br style="font-family: monospace;">
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">(defmethod create-app 
((interface app))</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp; (setf (app-prefs interface) 
(read-preferences-file)))</span><br>
  <br>
And this works great. However, as the app grew, I wanted to break out 
the code and make the preferences global (maybe in the future I would 
have multiple app interfaces open at once?).<br>
  <br>
So, I removed the create-app callback that read the preferences file and
 changed my "main" function to do the following:<br>
  <br>
(defvar *prefs* nil)<br>
  <br>
(defun launch ()<br>
&nbsp; (setq *prefs* (read-preferences-file))<br>
&nbsp; (display (make-instance 'app)))<br>
  <br>
When I do this, though, while it works in the IDE it completely hangs 
the delivered app. I can launch it, and whatever interface I set to 
display initially (even a display-message) will show up, but the 
interface is completely unresponsive and I need to force quit the 
application.<br>
  <br>
The *only* way I've worked around this is to put the (setq *prefs* ...) 
inside the cocoa-event-loop process. And there is nothing in 
read-preferences-file that requires the cocoa-event-loop.<br>
  <br>
At first I thought maybe this was a special variable issue; perhaps 
*prefs* was thread-local and perhaps the cocoa-event-loop was created 
before *prefs*? But if I make display-message show a value from *prefs* 
it is correct. So that's not it?<br>
  <br>
Anyway, here's what I would hope:<br>
  <br>
* If this is me being stupid, can someone explain to me why this is bad 
and what's happening under-the-hood?<br>
  <br>
* This took me several days to figure out going commit-by-commit until I
 figured out what change caused the issue. Is there a way to debug an 
unresponsive, delivered app (a key press to break into the REPL)?<br>
  <br>
Thanks for any info!<br>
