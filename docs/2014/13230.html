                <h1>Avoid automatic combining of invalidated rectangles?</h1>
                <pre>
In my application, I often have the need to invalidate a rectangle which
covers a strip in most of the upper part of the window, and a very small
rectangle in the lower right. For instance, a call to
invalidate-rectangle with x=32, y=1, width=362 and height=14, will often
be followed by a call to invalidate a very small rectangle (like  x=367, y=42, width=5 and
height=6). Clearly these are disjunct, but LW wants to be "smart" and
combines the two and thus invalidates a much larger rectangle.

The problem is that the second and very small rectangle is part of a
very complicated pinboard-object. Because of the merging of the two
rectangles, LW tells this object to draw all of, or almost all of itself
instead of only the tiny rectangle I wanted to redraw. And that means
spending up to 100ms drawing instead of 1ms or less :-(

So: Is there a way to make LW draw that upper rectangle as a separate
drawing operation and NOT combine it with the drawing of the small rectangle?

Perhaps you could workaround this by calling the display callback for
the second pinboard-object directly, instead of calling
invalidate-rectangle: eg:

(apply-in-pane-process pinboard 'capi:draw-pinboard-object pinboard
	object2 :x 367 :y 42 :width 5 :height 6)

[perversely, just before calling invalidate-rectangle]---Madhu

Hmm, thanks, I did something similar (applied draw-pinboard-object
directly on the first pinboard object when invalidating the small
section of the second one) and it actually seems to work (with the
addition that I have to draw a rectangle first to invalidate the region)
