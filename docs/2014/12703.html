                <h1>OS X :drop-callback on layouts not getting called</h1>
                <pre>
For some reason I can't seem to get the :drop-callback on a 
column-layout to get called. The exact same code works fine on Windows, 
but not on OS X.

(defclass task-layout (column-layout)
   ()
   (:default-initargs
    :gap 2
    :title-position :top
    :title-adjust :center
    :background :white
    :vertical-scroll t
    :visible-border :outline
    :visible-min-width 180
    :drop-callback 'drop-task-pane))

This is my subclass of column-layout. If I put a print or 
display-message at the very beginning of drop-task-pane I see that it is 
never called. The drop object is successfully created and I can see it 
being dragged around in the UI, too (note: I can even drag the object 
into another application and it copies over just fine).

Again, everything works wonderfully on Windows, just not on OS X. 
Wondering if I've missed a step that Windows gracefully handles and I 
don't know about?

Any thoughts/assistance appreciated. I also don't mind posting more code 
if it would help.

So, looking closer at the documentation and class browser, it would 
appear as though the drop-callback isn't actually supported for 
column-layouts. However, I'm still surprised that it works on Windows. 
I'm not at a Windows machine currently, but is the class hierarchy for 
CAPI different on Windows and OS X?

Anyway, having drop-callback support for layouts that aren't 
pinboard-layouts would be *extremely* helpful.

But, if I'm just missing something obvious, I'd be quite happy to be 
corrected. ;-)
