In my HTTP package for LW I have a with-headers macro.<br>

  <br>
It is used like so:<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">(with-headers ((content-length 
"Content-Length")</span><br>
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (content-type 
"Content-Type" :if-not-found "text/plain"))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (response-headers response)<br>
&nbsp; (print content-length)<br>
&nbsp; (print content-type))<br>
    <br>
  </span>However, I'd like to extend the macro so that the variables 
(e.g. content-length and content-type, among any others) are setf-able 
from within the macro body, which would overwrite the header value in 
the response (or request).<br>
  <br>
I've been trying to find a really good way to do this with a 
symbol-macrolet, but have been fairly unsuccessful, mostly because it 
requires an assoc call and I don't want to add the header in the 
:if-not-found case unless a setf is performed.<br>
  <br>
My attempts have roughly followed this train of thought:<br>
  <br>
* Create a 'place' variable that is the assoc lookup.<br>
* Then create a symbol-macrolet that is defined as (second place), which
 is setf-able.<br>
  <br>
But, when place is nil, I'm not sure how to go about adding the header 
(and subsequently redefining the place). I'm also very willing to remove
 the :if-not-found keyword if it dramatically simplifies the problem.<br>
  <br>
Thanks in advance for any helpful tips.<br>

Hi, does this help?

(let ((alist (list (cons 'x 3) (cons 'y 4) (cons 'z 5))))
  (flet (((setf lookup) (new-value key)
           (setf (cdr (assoc key alist)) new-value)))
    (symbol-macrolet ((y (lookup 'y)))
      (setf y 99)
      alist)))

;; =&gt ((X . 3) (Y . 99) (Z . 5))

Regards,
lmj
