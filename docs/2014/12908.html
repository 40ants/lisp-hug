                <h1>Stepping through code</h1>
                <pre>
Hi Everyone,

I'm curious does anyone know of a way to step through code like the way  
Visual studio does it except in the LW ide? I mean using a key like F8,  
instead of having to click a tiny button with the mouse at the top of the  
screen?

Hi!
  Problem is not with the keybinding. In fact the Lispworks stepper is
still a pretty useless toy, so the convinience of a Visual Studio is
not abailable (yet).
  No one steps the entire program through usually. One sets the
breakpoint, runs program and then steps starting from that breakpoint.
Consider the example: function "f" calls "g" and you set a breakpoint
in "g", your breakpoint fires and you are currently in a "g". You
begin stepping and at some point have to return to "f".
  In Visual Studio, you continue stepping through "f".
  This is not the case in the Lispworks.
  Problem is that the Lispworks needs to redefine any function it
steps through. This is bad by itself as compiled code is substitued by
the interpreted one. This occurs in a context which can differ from
the one where the function was defined initially. So the function you
step can differ dramatically from the function you call without
stepping.
  It would be nice if the Lispworks had a native code stepper. Indeed
there are some "known points" in a compiled code which are shown at
backtrace in a debugger. Just stepping through them and setting
breakpoints at them would suffice for a professional most of the time.
  The Lispworks contains other really useful tools for debugging:
(break), trace, print, restart frame. Together with the ability to
recompile a single function, these are rather powerful.
But they are Spartian compared to VS if you just want to press one key
and watch what goes on.

&gt
&gt I have to disagree. I spend a lot of time walking code through the LW
&gt stepper, and in spite of a couple of little quirks find it so useful
&gt that I wonder how I ever managed without it.
&gt

I find the stepper fairly nice as well. My only issue was at times I found  
myself clicking the buttons at the top way to much to get at what I  
needed, either that or create a watch point. Now thanks to your key  
binding suggestion I'm a happy hacker.

&gt Is there some magic in the IDE where it sees the in-package form and does something?
Yes. Current package is changed in (in-package ...) form is present in
a file. You can see it near the window's bottom. This is a must for
all files to have IDE working correctly and for correct redefinition
of a signle forms in a file with commands like "compile defun". If you
don't use "compile defun" command, you certainly miss a half of CL's
productivity, take a time to learn it.
