                <h1>Focus pane on Windows</h1>
                <pre>
The function capi:pane-has-focus-p has different behaviors on Windows 
and OS X. Well, to be fair it's probably consistent with what's going on 
under the hood, but the end-result is different for the application.

If I have a layout with a bunch of output-panes in them, and each pane 
:accepts-focus-p t, on OS X I can just check whether or not the pane has 
focus to render it differently. And I can be assured that even if my 
application loses focus the output-pane will draw appropriately. On 
Windows, however, if the application loses focus then the pane also 
loses focus and all my checks fail.

My current work-around is to let the layout track the currently selected 
pane(s) within it. This isn't a huge deal, but I was just wondering if 
there was a simple way so that on Windows, when the application loses 
focus the panes within the interface do not (similar to a choice's 
:keep-selection-p option)?
