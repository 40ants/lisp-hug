                <h1>CAPI with opengl programmable pipeline</h1><div dir="ltr">Hi,<div>I looked at the opengl example in the lispworks examples directory. It uses the fixed programmable pipeline. I have used that as a source and wrote 2-3 opengl based prototype apps. Works fine.</div><div>
<br></div><div>However, I want to move to the opengl programmable pipeline. If anyone has done that, and could share example code/experience in doing so, would be great as a starting point. </div><div><br></div><div style>
Btw, while coding up a few opengl examples, I wrote a small utility so that animations can be synced with the vsync. I have attached the file. Just pass the start-animation-with-vsync a function that does stuff you want and (re)displays the canvas containing the opengl pane. Ensure that you load this display.lisp after loading the opengl system.</div>
<div style><br></div><div style>The other patch is for anti aliasing. Replace cocoa.lisp with cocoa.lisp in the opengl code in LW distribution. Please take a backup of your cocoa.lisp! Kindly note that the vsycn and anti aliasing patches are tested only on LW for Mac. Hopefully the patches are useful.</div>

If you are interested, please write to me privately and I will prepare something to share with you.</div><div><br></div><div>Remember that a DisplayLink is actually a separate thread, therefore you have to ensure you do not modify code in a unsafe manner. &nbsp;I have not found a proper way to do that from the REPL at the moment.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Best,</div><div>Cam</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br><div><div>On 27 Jan 2014, at 16:21, Deepak Surti &lt;<a href="mailto:dmsurti@gmail.com">dmsurti@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:</div><br class="Apple-interchange-newline"><blockquote type="cite"><div dir="ltr">Hi,<div>I looked at the opengl example in the lispworks examples directory.
