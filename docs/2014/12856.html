                <h1>ANN: Kanban task app</h1>
                <pre>
I've been working on my first real LWM app. It's mostly for myself 
(hobbyist LW user), but recently a friend commented that others might 
also like it. It's a project task tracker app. I personally really like 
kanbans, but have always wanted a few other features tossed in.

Here's a couple screenshots:

http://scratchtask.com/i/kanban_all.png
http://scratchtask.com/i/kanban_burndown.png

Anyway, it's getting close to something releasable, and if anyone here 
would be interested in beta testing such an app  (seeing as how anyone 
in here would hopefully be comfortable in the LW debugger and sending be 
a backtrace if something bad should happen). And - of course - yell at 
me about bad UI. :-)

I've tested it on LWW (personal edition) and it works wonderfully, but I 
don't own the pro edition of LWW currently.

Please feel free to fire me an email if interested. Otherwise, here's 
just me smiling at my first completed Lisp app that actually is getting 
some use...

The app is looking good!
Please include me in your list of testers.
