                <h1>BROWSER-PANE and JS warnings</h1>
                <pre>
Another BROWSER-PANE issue, again LWW 6.1.1 on Win7:

For almost every commercial website I tried, I get annoying Javascript
warnings from the browser pane.  My guess would be that BROWSER-PANE
is based on an old IE version that's lurking somewhere in the guts of
Windows.  Is that right?

Is there a way to get rid of these messages or to switch to a newer IE version?

Thanks,
Edi.

The WebBrowser component uses whatever version of IE that is installed.

Switching to another IE version is installing a new IE version, which
is restrained in some versions of Windows (up to IE8 on XP, up to IE9
in Vista).

In IE 8+, by default the content of a WebBrowser control is in IE7
Standards Mode, see the following IEBlog posts:

It would be interesting to know which specific warnings you're
getting.  It's possible to implement some COM interfaces to tell what
security zone applies to an URL, disable warnings and use a separate
registry key path for browser settings, though it doesn't follow the
usual IUnknown::QueryInterface path, but
IServiceProvider::QueryService instead.

Best regards,

Paulo Madeira

I'm on Win7 and the IE installed is 11.

The warnings I get are script errors - and LOTS of them.  I'm given
the option to stop running scripts, but even if I select that, the
error messages continue to pop up because many pages have JS from
different URLs.

A random example would be
http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/companyNews/~3/tp09XLDhr-Q/story01.htm
which runs fine on IE 11 but is unacceptable in a browser pane.

Apart from me not being a COM expert, implementing different security
settings per URL would not be an option as this is for an app where we
won't know in advance which sites the user might want to visit.

Thanks for your help,
Edi.

I can replicate your problem.

The WebBrowser's Silent property seems to disable dialog boxes, so let's try it.

I took your other example and added this URL to the choices.  Then, I
displayed the interface and browsed for the browser-pane manually in
the IDE's Window Browser, right-click and Listen, followed by (setf
*p* *) in the Listener.

Setting the IWebBrowser2::Silent property to true in LW should be
something like the following:

(capi:apply-in-pane-process
 *p*
 #'(lambda ()
     (setf (com:invoke-dispatch-get-property
            (capi:ole-control-i-dispatch
             (capi-internals::pane-implementation *p*)) "Silent")
           t)))

I discovered some details by inspecting the guts of the browser-pane,
so I guess this code should be contained in some win32 utility
function that may depend on LW's version.

&gt Apart from me not being a COM expert, implementing different security
&gt settings per URL would not be an option as this is for an app where we
&gt won't know in advance which sites the user might want to visit.

You don't need to be an expert, but these things do tend to be kind of ugly.

Ah, wonderful, that seems to fix the problem.  Thanks a lot, Paulo!
