                <pre>
Hi everybody,

I'm trying to translate something like this from C to Lisp:

  typedef struct {
    int one;
    int two;
    struct {
      int three;
      int four;
    } bar;
  } foo;

I first tried this:

  (define-c-struct foo
    (one :int)
    (two :int)
    (bar (:struct (three :int)
                  (four :int))))

Then this:

  (define-c-struct bar
    (three :int)
    (four :int))

  (define-c-struct foo
    (one :int)
    (two :int)
    (bar bar))

And then this:

  (define-c-typedef bar-struct (:struct bar))

  (define-c-struct foo
    (one :int)
    (two :int)
    (bar bar-struct))

All three definitions are accepted by LispWorks, but in none of
these cases am I able to access the slots THREE and FOUR - I
always get:

  "Attempted to dereference a pointer to aggregate type..."

What is the right idiom to do this?

And, actually, the real problem is even more complicated as I
have to deal with a struct which contains a union of two other
structs.  But I think the short example above demonstrates where
I can't proceed.

Thanks in advance for your help,
Edi.

Ah, wait!  Just after I sent this I came across FOREIGN-SLOT-POINTER
which seems to do what I want.

(Still, even if this hopefully solves my problem I'd suggest to add a
couple more examples with complicated C structs and unions and how to
access them to the FLI docs.)

Edi this is documented behavior

Check FLI:DEREFERENCE keyword args AFAIR

For later, try to FOREIGN-PARSER the header to get clues about how to
translate to FLI

Raymond, thanks a lot.  I had never used lists as slot names before,
but I now see that they are documented and that there's even an
example with nested structs in the documentation entry for
FOREIGN-SLOT-VALUE.  Shame on me...

Thanks,
Edi.
