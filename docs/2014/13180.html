                <h1>Column layout background color bug (OS X)</h1>
                <pre>
On OS X I can't get the background color of a column layout to extend 
past its last child pane. On Windows everything works as expected, 
though. Here's a screenshot to give an example:

http://scratchtask.com/i/redshirt_rss.png

On the left side is the feed list. You'll notice that after the last 
feed, the background color is different. The background color (:gray33) 
is the same for both the layout *and* the feed output-panes inside the 
layout. But it always appears lighter for the layout. I could make them 
both blue and the layout would be a lighter shade of blue than the feeds.

I've had this issue on other projects as well and the only solution I 
could come up with was a hack: create an output-pane that would expand 
height-wise that was the background I wanted it to be, and ensure it was 
always in the layout-description. That was quite annoying, though, as 
any looping over the child panes required making sure I wasn't doing 
something to the final pane. I also had to make sure that the pane was 
always there.

Is this a bug or am I failing to do something on OS X to rectify this?
