Hi,

We are accessing hash tables from several threads, and see that locking the hash tables using the LispWorks locks for hash tables is too coarse-grained. We have some ideas how to fix this, but are wondering if anybody else has encountered this, and whether there already exist solutions, maybe in the form of third-party libraries (lock-free hash tables, anyone?).

Thanks,
Pascal

&gt 
&gt LispWorks hash tables provide atomic (thread-safe) access by default, without
&gt any need for explicit locking.

I’m thinking about http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw61/LW/html/lw-868.htm and http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw61/LW/html/lw-810..htm

An important idiom for us is this:

(hcl:with-hash-table-locked (table)
   (let ((value (gethash key table)))
     (cond (value (remhash key table) value)
               (t (setf (gethash key table) value))))

This should be atomic, ideally without preventing other threads from accessing other entries in the hash table. Since both clauses of the cond access the table again, we need to protect the whole operation with a lock, though.

Also this:

(or (gethash key table)
      (hcl:with-hash-table-locked (table)
          (or (gethash key table)
               (setf (gethash key table) value))))

is already problematic for us because we do not encounter the keys often enough to avoid the locking often enough. The documentation for modify-hash sounds like it also locks the complete table, or is it more fine-grained?

Thanks a lot,
Pascal

Unfortunately, modify-hash uses with-hash-table-locked.  Also, it can't do
remhash (as in your first example).  I'm not sure if a fine-grained lock could
be used without impacting setf gethash and remhash.

I think making modify-hash completely lock-free would be impossible in the
general case, unless its specification was changed to allow the modification
function to be called more than once (which is an interesting idea).

Maybe make-hash-table could accept a keyword parameter that allows it to be used with a lock-free version of modify-hash (which could then have slightly different semantics, with regard to number of times being called, supporting remhash functionality, and disallowing setf gethash, etc.)

I think performance-conscientious would be fine with such restrictions…
