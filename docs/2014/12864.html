I'd like to know when a drop-object is no longer viable to be dropped 
somewhere, but I don't seem to have access to that. In my particular 
case, I have a column layout, and each pane in the layout is an output 
pane. If the item in question is dropped on one of the panes then it's 
added to the layout immediately before the pane it was dropped on.

This all works great, and now what I'm hoping to do is - while the 
object is being dragged - visually show what's going to happen. To do 
this, I have a "spacer" pane that I insert into the layout as the object 
is being dragged around, shifting everything down. This works quite well 
also.

However, if I don't actually drop the object into the layout, (or if it 
leaves the layout) I have no way of knowing this and removing the visual 
spacer from the layout-description.

Is this information possible for me to know or am I pretty much out of luck?

To answer my own question, it looks like :leave is sent in the 
drop-callback as well.
