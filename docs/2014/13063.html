                <h1>Curious case of slowdown with file output</h1>
                <pre>
Hi,

We have encountered a curious case of slowdown with file output: When performing an (open pathname :direction :output :if-exists :supersede), if the file indeed already exists, output is dramatically slower than if the file didn’t exist before. We see a degradation of a factor of 3, which can hurt a lot for very large files (several gigabytes). By doing a (when-let (path (probe-file pathname)) (assert (delete-file path))) before the call to ‘open, the slowdown can be avoided.

Does anybody know a different / better keyword to pass to :if-exists to avoid this issue? :rename-and-delete sounds clunky, but maybe that’s better?

This is in LispWorks 64bit on Linux.

Thanks,
Pascal

Have you checked the I/O load on the machine?  Using :if-exists :supersede
causes the file to be opened with O_TRUNC, so this might be interacting badly
with the auto_da_alloc mount option if you are using ext4 (see
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/ext4.txt).

:rename-and-delete will not be better because we treat it as a synonym for
:supersede.
