But, again, I insist that native code stepper would be much, much
better in architectural sence even despite less detail it would give.

I think that native-code stepping is reasonably hard to do in a useful way in a language with macros.  I've never actually found stepping Lisp useful (including on LispMs).

&gt II think that native-code stepping is reasonably hard to do in a useful way in a language with macros.
Indeed this is hard, but there are more or less successful examples of
such implementation. E.g. #line directive in C allows to control a
stepper when code transformations are used. Some time ago I suggested
to implement similar things for Lispworks, and I even posted some
prototype code for particular cases (e.g., for iterate). Lispworks
developers promised to work on it.

&gt The moment you stop single-stepping the code, you will quite likely be able to re-compile the code that you were stepping through.
Is I have mentioned above, there are problems:
i) compilation context might differ in some tricky cases and there is
no predicate to check if we are in tricky case or not. So, setting a
breakpoint potentially converts function in a way which differs its
behaviour
ii) When you return from stepped function to a function which was not
compiled with stepper enabled, you're unable to step through it. I
guess there could be possible to recompile caller function just before
actual return and to redirect execution path from non-stepped function
into stepped, but this is not implemented in current version of
Lispworks stepper and I'm not sure that is easier than implement
native-code stepper.
iii) doing "restart frame stepping" works well for a code without side
effects only. Again, there is no "pure-functional-p" predicate to
check if it is safe to do restart frame.

Yeah ... I wish I still had one :( 

Like the Symbolics 3600 I used 30 years ago.
