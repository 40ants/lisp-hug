                <h1>Drawing in a user defined coordinate system</h1>
                <pre>
Hey there,

I have a CAPI output-pane in which I would like to draw individual items at different locations.
Each item has its own coordinate system, and a frame location in the pane’s coordinate system.

I am searching for way to temporarily apply a coordinate system transformation.

I have found gp:set-graphics-port-coordinates, alas it sets the coordinates of the entire port and is destructive.
I also found graphics-state transformations but haven’t got to understand how to use it the way I would like.

Or perhaps should I use pinboard objects?

Thank you so much in advance!

Cam

Hi again,

Sorry for the noise...

Re-reading the Generalized points section of the CAPI/GP manual, I understood that the 6 elements of the transformation matrix were indeed the arguments for the :transform property of a graphic-state.

http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw60/CAPUG-M/html/capiuser-m-166.htm#pgfId-886173

I was a bit unclear, but looking at the definition of gp:make-transform confirms that.
