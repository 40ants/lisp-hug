                <h1>Popup CAPI panes</h1>
                <pre>
Has anyone been successful creating "fixed-position" interface panes on 
top of other panes/layouts?

An example of what I'm referring to is the "find" field in Chrome. When 
the user presses Ctrl-F the browser viewport has a little "find" box 
appear in the upper-right:

I've tried playing with various pinboard-layouts and such, and can't get 
anything like this.

I can - potentially - create a borderless, shadowless, child interface, 
and in the geometry-changed-callback of the parent I can move the child 
interface as well, but past experience tells me they won't stay 
perfectly in sync (there could be a drag delay, etc). And before I go 
down that road I'd like to make sure there's no built-in way for me to 
do this. Or maybe someone's already come up with something else that 
does this?

Thanks!

Jeff M.

Maybe this?

Or have I misunderstood your question?
