I would like to add some comments about this interesting experience. Thanks for any comment or corrections because I have always a lot of things to learn from you.</div><div><br></div><div>Before this experience, I really never understand nothing about this question of optimization because, when I test it, (speed 3) generally doesn’t offer any difference… Now I realize that this feeling was completely wrong. The main module I optimized was a drawing module, so it uses many single-float geometric computation (I work on a 32 bits version of lw 5) and the result of optimization was amazing : with floats, it’s possible (in testing environment) to divide the time of computation by 50, or even more, and to reduce the consumption of memory to nothing. Practically, the drawing process of my application consumes now 40% of the time it consumed before (20% being the - irreducible - drawing itself), and less than 5% of the memory (before optimization, drawing the view completely can consume several MB). The gain is very noticeable, especially during scrolling, &nbsp;resizing, zooming and so on. But another observable result is that the codes are at least 2 times longer and more difficult to read. However, they are also safer and simpler to maintain because types are explicit.</div><div><br></div><div>During the process of optimization, my goal was to reduce the memory consumption of low-level functions used by this module to zero. Generally it was a good way to obtain a drastic reduction of the consumption of time. (float 0) is essential, but it must be combined with (safety 0) to obtain the «&nbsp;optimized environment ». If each variable going in an operator is typed, the compiler uses the typed version of this operator (you can see that when disassemble), the main gain of time is there. The main gain of space is to avoid boxing and unboxing numbers. So it is not a good idea to switch too often between optimized an non optimized environment. To store unboxed floats, the only solution is to use typed arrays (don’t trust type declarations in classes or structures : they never store raw values). Passing arguments between functions (even local functions like flet) can become difficult because optimized floats are boxed at this point. The only solution is to pass typed arrays (even single index arrays, equivalent to a kind of « customized box&nbsp;») between functions, and/or to use inlined functions (and/or macros). So the type of each float variable should be declared if you plane to use it for computation (even in loops). The type of typed arrays should be declared too. Numeric constants must be typed (I mean 1.0 not 1). Global variables must be typed with «&nbsp;the&nbsp;» (no other solution, even if «&nbsp;the&nbsp;» is really not the best way to declare types) - the declaration (defvar *foo* (the single-float 1.0)) is useless.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>for instance :</div><div><div>(defvar *increment* 1.0)</div><div><br></div><div>NON OPTIMIZED</div><div><br></div><div><div>(defun test () (loop for f = 1.0 then (+ f *increment*) while (&lt; f 20) sum f))</div><div><br></div><div>(time (test)) =&gt; 190.0, 0ms,&nbsp;<b>340</b>&nbsp;bytes.

LW provides the :explain declaration

http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw61/LW/html/lw-638.htm

In short it shows what is the compiler is trying to do.

(defun test ()
  (declare (optimize (speed 3) (safety 0) (float 0)))
  (declare (:explain :types))
  (loop for f of-type single-float = 1.0 then (+ f (the single-float
*increment*))
        while (&lt; f 20.0) sum f into total of-type single-float
        finally (return total)))

(compile 'test) ;; look at the compiler output.

Ala'a

Indeed, you are coding closer to the way you would in C. Is this
unexpected, and could it be avoided? I don't think so.

Things could be improved by better semantic analysis in the compiler:
extended lifetime analysis, type propagation and inference, interval
analysis, and so on. That would remove some of the burden from the
Lisp programmer.

However, I wouldn't say that XCode 5 would be a better place to do
development in, principally because if you're down to the C level,
you're locked in it. I can't prototype, modify safety settings as
much, and so on.

An experienced Lisp programmer who is very adept with his or her
compiler of choice can produce a reasonably equivalent to a C
programmer in the same, if not shorter time. And more likely than not,
the Lisp programmer's program will be safer and better debugged. It's
true that C-like Lisp is longer than just C, but that's because Lisp
makes all unsafe points/performant points/etc more explicit.

Cheers,

Robert

You cannot declaim that!  You've not checked that
*read-default-float-format* is single-float, so *increment* could be of
another float type.

You should write either:

    (setf *read-default-float-format* 'single-float)
    (defvar *increment* 1.0)
    (declaim (type single-float *increment*))

or:

    (defvar *increment* 1.0)
    (eval-when (:compile-toplevel :load-toplevel :execute)
      (proclaim `(type ,*read-default-float-format* *increment*)))


or:

    (defvar *increment* 1.0f0)
    (declaim (type single-float *increment*))

And what good would that do to people loading your code in other

Sure, you could and probably should set it up in your rc files, but you
should also explicitely set it in  your source files, if you depend on
it.


&gt&gt    (defvar *increment* 1.0)
&gt&gt    (declaim (type single-float *increment*))
&gt
&gt ...and after declare the variables as Martin told me ?

But if you depend on a specific float type for a given variable, you
should probably better explicitely give a specifically typed literal
such as 1.0f0.
