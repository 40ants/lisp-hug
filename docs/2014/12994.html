                <h1>Trying to understand the macroexpansion of an iterate clause</h1>
                <pre>
Dear List

I am reading the iterate manual and have come across this form:
  (iter (generating (key . item) in '((a . 1) (b . 2) (c . 2)))
	(collect (next key))
	(collect (next item)))
The manual says that the form returns (a 2 c).

I have pasted the result of (macroexpand-1  form), where form is the
above iter form, but I have removed all the `#:' prefixes of the
variables, to http://paste.lisp.org/+31RO (the O is the
upper-case letter oh).

I have dry run the expanded code 3 times and I still do not understand
how the variable result21 is bound to a list whose length is &gt 1. The
only places in the expanded code where result21 is bound to a new value
consists of a SETQ with the value bound to temp24. During my dry
running, it appears that temp24 is bound to, successively, (a) (2)
(c). Using the Stepper tool, I have discovered that the value result21
is bound to, changes when end-pointer23 is bound to "(a 2)", but the
value in end-pointer23 is never used to change another variable.

So what changes the value of result21? And where?

Your help would be appreciated.

Sincerely

The code updating RESULT21 is the following form:

 (SETQ END-POINTER23
       (IF RESULT21
           (SETF (CDR END-POINTER23) TEMP24)
         (SETQ RESULT21 TEMP24)))

TEMP24, RESULT21, and END-POINTER23 all have the same initial value: the
cons '(A . NIL).  During subsequent evaluations the above form adds
items to the RESULT21 list in-place by replacing the cdr of the last
cons with a list containing each new item.


Mike

A chine nual, is a book with a big title written on the cover like this:

             +--------------+
             |     |  | LISP|
             |     |  |     |
             |     |MA|CHINE|
             |     |  |     |
             |     |MA|NUAL |
             +--------------+

so when the book is folded, you can read CHINE NUAL:

             ------+
             | LISP|
             |     |
             |CHINE|
             |     |
             |NUAL |
             ------+

That is great! :)

My copy of David Moon's book looks quite different, as I recall. Must be the Symbolics reprinted edition ... I have to go find it and look! :)
