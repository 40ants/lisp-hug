                <h1>CAPI and create-callback</h1>
                <pre>
Is there a way for me to have different create-callbacks called? I'm 
guessing not, but right now I have the following:

Subclass my-output-pane has a :create-callback which does a bunch of 
required setup work. I'd also like to create a subclass of 
my-output-pane that does additional setup work.

I know I can use CLOS and :after, but that requires knowledge of the 
create-callback symbol name. If I supply a different :create-callback 
then it's overridden (from what I can tell) and the create-callback for 
my-output-pane is never called.

Summary: I know of ways I can get the behavior I want via CLOS, etc. but 
was wondering if there was a nice CAPI way of doing this?

I think you may want to put your code in either initialize-instance or
interface-display methods. Notice this in the documentation of
capi:interface:

"Note: create-callback should be used only for operations that must be
done with the interface already created and cannot be done in
interface-display. Otherwise they should be either done in
initialize-instance or between your calls to make-instance and
display. An operation that needs to run after the interface is created
but just before displaying the interface as an ordinary window (typical
cases are font queries and loading images) can be put in the
interface-display :before method. An operation that needs to run just
after displaying the interface as an ordinary window can be put in the
interface-display :after method."

If I understand correctly, one solution is to dispatch to a generic
function, which may be what you had in mind. The user writes a method
specialization instead of passing a :create-callback argument.

(defclass my-output-pane (capi:output-pane)
  ()
  (:default-initargs :create-callback 'create-callback))

(defclass my-output-pane-subclass (my-output-pane)
  ())

(defgeneric create-callback (obj)
  (:method-combination progn :most-specific-last))

(defmethod create-callback progn ((obj my-output-pane))
  (break "my-output-pane callback"))

(defmethod create-callback progn ((obj my-output-pane-subclass))
  (break "my-output-pane-subclass callback"))

(capi:contain (make-instance 'my-output-pane))
;;; =&gt calls my-output-pane callback

(capi:contain (make-instance 'my-output-pane-subclass))
;;; =&gt calls my-output-pane callback, then the subclass callback

An on-the-fly :create-callback argument can be handled by playing
tricks with the initarg list. (Though such trickery is a last resort,
in my view.)

(defmethod initialize-instance ((instance my-output-pane)
                                &amp;rest initargs &amp;key &amp;allow-other-keys)
  (let ((create-callback (getf initargs :create-callback)))
    (if (eq create-callback 'create-callback)
        (call-next-method)
        (let ((new-initargs (copy-list initargs)))
          (setf (getf new-initargs :create-callback)
                (if create-callback
                    (lambda (obj)
                      (create-callback obj)
                      (funcall create-callback obj))
                    'create-callback))
          (apply #'call-next-method instance new-initargs)))))

(capi:contain (make-instance 'my-output-pane-subclass
                             :create-callback
                             (lambda (obj)
                               (break "user callback"))))
;;; =&gt calls all three callbacks; user callback is last

&gt This is what I have currently. It works fine, but feels strange to me. That said, I'm still not fully comfortable with CLOS generic method ordering (:before, :after, :around), and I don't understand what your example of 'progn' does.

One primary method together with only :after specializations for
subclasses is basically the same as the progn :most-specific-last
method combination, save for the return value. I chose progn because I
pictured the callbacks as a chain of equal-stature functions rather
than one specially designated function (the primary method) with
others sprinkled on top (aux methods), but it doesn't matter a whole
lot.

&gt Your initialize-instance idea is quite interesting as well. I agree that it feels like a last resort. But it's neat to see that it's possible that way.

In retrospect it's not that bad as long as it accomplishes what is
needed and the "switcheroo" move is noted (if only for yourself six
months from now).

&gt On a side note, something I've never figured out is how to remove a method in a 'chain'. For example, if I create an initialize-instance method :after, and later decide I don't want it, then the only options I've really had are to kill LW and restart the image or compile the method with an empty body. Is there something else I could do?

(defgeneric foo (x))
(defmethod foo ((x integer)) x)
(defmethod foo :after ((x integer)) (break "foo"))
(foo 3) ;=&gt break
(remove-method #'foo (find-method #'foo '(:after)
                                  (list (find-class 'integer))))
(foo 3) ;=&gt 3
