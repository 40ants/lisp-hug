                <h1>Combining masks</h1>
                <pre>
Hi,

Running this code

(gp:with-graphics-mask (pane (list 100 100 50 50))
  (gp:with-graphics-mask (pane (list 0 0 500 500))
    (gp:draw-rectangle pane 0 0 500 500 :filled t :foreground :red)))

results in a 500x500 rectangle being drawn. Apparently, the second mask overrides the first, while I would have expected them to be combined so that both masks restrict the drawing area.

Is this a bug in GP, or is it expected behavior? In the latter case, is there any workaround?

Regards
Erik

This isn't a bug in GP, WITH-GRAPHICS-MASK works as specified: it merely
`binds the mask slot of a port's graphics state across the execution of
a body of code', and here we are changing the binding twice.

I haven't really used these functions, but you there may be an ugly
workaround to get what you want: by chaining WITH-PIXMAP-GRAPHICS-PORT
within successive scopes of WITH-GRAPHICS-MASK and drawing to this port
and finally copying the pixels of the innermost pixmap port back to the
pane...---Madhu

That is definitely less ugly when all the shapes all rectangles.

Perhaps there was also some way to intersect (:path ...) masks easily?
If GP was computing this, could it be exposed?  [i.e. without producing
the pixmap.  A pointer to the algorithm may also help]---Regards, Madhu
