                <h1>Command line on LW Windows</h1>
                <pre>
Hello,

I am trying to launch a LispWorks 6.1 process from Clozure CL.
It is invoked from CCL like this (this is the exact command constructed in CCL):

&gt C:\Progra~1\LispWorks\lispworks-6-1-0-x86-win32 -init - -siteinit - -eval (load #P"C:/lisp/cl-test-grid/agent/proc-common.lisp") -eval (set-response #P"C:/lisp/cl-test-grid/work-dir/agent/response2714567116176465343.lisp" "abcs *() { /d e11 ") -eval (lispworks:quit)

LispWorks is launched but falls into the debugger with the following error:

&gt Reader cannot find package C.

The string argument to READ-FROM-STRING being:

&gt "(load #P\\C:/lisp/cl-test-grid/agent/proc-common.lisp\\)"

It seems something wrong happened to the quotes around the pathname.

Do you know how can I work around this problem?


Best Regards,
Camille

This smells to me as if you are running LW via some kind of shell interface and running into the usual horror of second-guessing the shell's quoting rules (if not the related but worse horrors of trying to be sure that the command line you are constructing actually does what you want rather than deleting all your files or something).

On Unixoid systems, anyway, the natural way of doing this in CCL is using RUN-PROGRAM which I don't think goes via the shell, and so doesn't suffer from this: the arguments you give the process are the arguments it gets.  It may be that on Windows RUN-PROGRAM goes by some shell (cmd.exe?) in which case you're doomed in principle but can probably work around it by adding backslashes or something.
