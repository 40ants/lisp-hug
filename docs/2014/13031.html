                <h1>Thread-safe slot accessors in CLOS</h1>
                <pre>
I've found myself doing the following periodically:

(defclass foo ()
   ((bar :initarg :bar :initform nil :reader foo-bar)))

(defmethod (setf foo-bar) (new-value (foo foo))
   (sys:atomic-exchange (slot-value foo 'bar) new-value))

I do this because bar is being used in another thread (obviously), and I 
want it to be safely setf-able. I'm just wondering if there's a nice 
LW-y way to do this from within the class definition? For example:

(defclass foo ()
   ((bar :initarg :bar :initform nil :accessor foo-bar :safety :atomic)))

Has an option like this ever been considered for LW? Or perhaps making 
an option so the :writer is automatically wrapped in some manner?

I think David McClain's point might answer this.  But if it doesn't and if you were really feeling your oats, I think you could implement something like this using the CLOS MOP: you'd need a metaclass, and then to have the reader/writer methods be some subclass of the standard one, and to check for slot options at class definition time.  I haven't tried doing this, but it looks possible.
