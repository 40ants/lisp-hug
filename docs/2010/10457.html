                <h1>Edit menu functions in delivered Mac apps</h1>
                <pre>
Something tells me there's an elegant way to implement the standard editing commands in a delivered Mac app, but I'm not finding it.

All I'm trying to do is have Cut, Copy and Paste work for text-input-panes in my application, which has several different interfaces containing text-input-panes. I'd like to simply have these work from the application-interface's Edit menu, rather than having to define an Edit menu for each kind of interface.

That should work if I could get the interface object of the front-most window. Is there a command for that? Or is there a different recommend approach?

OK, as is often the case, I found the answer, although it was not in an obvious location.

Browsing through the index in the LispWorks Reference Manual, I noticed active-pane-copy, and so on, among the New in LispWorks 6.0 entries.

Sorry for the noise, although a linear search through the reference manual index is not a very good way to find things. I didn't think to look at the rich-text-editor example in the examples file.

Regarding linear search let me add a shameless plug here.  You could
have looked for "paste" or "copy" in the permuted index provided by
