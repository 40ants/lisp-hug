Hi, LispWorks

Is it possible to deliver a single .exe program which can be switched from Console and GUI mode? I want this:

1. When calling without specific command-line options (like "-cmd"), it will run as a normal GUI program,
2. When calling with specific command-line options (like "-cmd"), it will run in console window.

The reason I want such behaviour is because I'm writing a program, some kind of networking client. When being clicked directly, it's a GUI program, which have all options in its GUI Window; but it can also be used as a UNIX-like command line program, with all input as command line options and output to standard output.

I tried to use both (:console t) and (:interface :capi) in my deliver script, it basically worked, but in GUI mode a win32 console black window still came with it, and I don't want this.

Is there any way I can write such a single program?

Regards,

Chun Tian (binghe)
