                <h1>Bizarre deadlock with only one lock - (LW6.01/32/Win32/Quad-core 
                 Intel/Vista64)</h1>
                <pre>
I tried to distill the problem into a single code fragment (below).  If
the problem won't repeat, perhaps change "workers-available" or put it
in a function and compile it.  It repeated faster on a beefy quad-core
than on a slower XP dual; but would repeat.  I think it's a multi-CPU thing.

The "wl" macrolet merely expands to mp:with-lock and the single lock
created in the code fragment.

Example failure point:
........
Making thread #:G1590

Error: Trying to lock 134220981 :
           Deadlock {simple} : waiting for another stack which waits for
the current thread.
  Other stack: #&lt;MP:PROCESS Name "Worker #:G1588" Priority 0 State
"PROCESS-LOCK waiting for Worker thread lock"&gt
  Waits for:  #&lt;MP:LOCK "Worker thread lock" Locked once by "CAPI
Execution Listener 1" 2071ABCB&gt

The failure occurs  where, according to a stack trace, the listener
process is still inside the "process-run-function" call, with the lock
still held.  Notice though from the dump - the thread it was making
above was G1590; but the "other stack" is listed as G1588.

Is it legal to start a thread from within a thread that happens to hold
a lock?  That's all I can see that could be wrong here in code, since
otherwise there is only one lock. . . .

Should I be doing this differently, or should I write this up as a
potential LW6.01 issue?

Anyway, the code is listed below:



(let ((lock (mp:make-lock :name "Worker thread lock"))
      (workers-available 16))
  (macrolet ((wl (&amp;body body) `(mp:with-lock (lock) (prog1 (let nil
,@body)))))
    (labels ((worker-thread-run ()
               (wl
                (incf workers-available)))
             (give-work ()
               (wl
                (unless (zerop workers-available)
                  (decf workers-available)
                  (let ((id (gensym)))
                    (format t "Making thread ~S" id)
                    (terpri)
                    (mp:process-run-function (format nil "Worker ~S" id)
nil #'worker-thread-run))))))
      (loop while t do
            (give-work)
            (sleep 0)))))
