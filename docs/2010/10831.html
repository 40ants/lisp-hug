My delivered application (LWM 6.0.1, Mac OS X v. 10.6.5) seems to quit when all its windows are closed.

Apropos seems to be telling me there's a symbol SET-QUIT-WHEN-NO-WINDOWS, which sounds suspicious enough. Unfortunately, I'm finding that searching the contents of all manuals, as well as searching something as simple as QUIT in the Lisp Knowledgebase, finds nothing about it.

Is there any documentation on this?

OK, it was obvious enough how this function works, once I found it. In fact, it worked on my first try. But I must have spent a day looking for non-existent bugs in my code before I got to it.
