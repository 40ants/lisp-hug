Scope
~~~~~~
The purpose of the European Lisp Symposium is to provide a forum for
the discussion and dissemination of all aspects of design,
implementation and application of any of the Lisp dialects, including
Common Lisp, Scheme, Emacs Lisp, AutoLisp, ISLISP, Dylan, Clojure,
ACL2, ECMAScript, Racket and so on. We encourage everyone interested
in Lisp to participate.

The European Lisp Symposium 2011 invites high quality papers about
novel research results, insights and lessons learned from practical
applications, and educational perspectives. We also encourage
submissions about known ideas as long as they are presented in a new
setting and/or in a highly elegant way.

This year's focus will be directed towards "Parallelism &amp; Efficiency".
We especially invite submissions in the following areas:

+ Parallel and distributed computing
+ Code generation for multi-core architectures
+ Code generation for HTM
+ Large and ultra-large systems
+ Optimization techniques
+ Embedded applications

Contributions are also welcome in other areas, including but not
limited to:

+ Context-, aspect-, domain-oriented and generative programming
+ Macro-, reflective-, meta- and/or rule-based development approaches
+ Language design and implementation
+ Language integration, inter-operation and deployment
+ Development methodologies, support and environments
+ Educational approaches and perspectives
+ Experience reports and case studies


Technical Program:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We invite submissions in the following forms:

* Papers: Technical papers of up to 15 pages that describe original
  results or explain known ideas in new and elegant ways.

* Demonstrations: Abstracts of up to 4 pages for demonstrations of
  tools, libraries, and applications.

* Tutorials: Abstracts of up to 4 pages for in-depth presentations
  about topics of special interest for at least 90 minutes and up to
  180 minutes.

* Lightning talks: Abstracts of up to one page for talks to last for
  no more than 5 minutes.

All submissions should be formatted following the ACM SIGS guidelines
and include ACM classification categories and terms. For more
information on the submission guidelines and the ACM keywords, see:
