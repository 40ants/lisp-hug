                <h1>Redirecting stdout/stderr to the listener in the IDE</h1>
                <pre>
Hi folks,

I'm using FLI to connect to a "C" library, and some functions of that
library print directly to stdout/stderr.

I can get the output, if I run the console version of Lispworks. But
from the IDE I can't do much.

I've looked through the documentation, but couldn't find anything that
it possible.

How would one do this?

I'm running Lispworks 6.0 32.bit on both my Mac OS X, and Windows XP,
so I'm interrested in solution for both if there is any.

Thanks,

Maybe system:open-pipe or system:call-system would allow you to capture that?

I've looked through them, but they call a different process.

To make the things simpler, how to get "puts" to print on the lisp IDE
console,  or at least somewhere?

(fli:define-foreign-function (puts "puts")
    ((text (:reference-pass :ef-mb-string))))

and then get

(puts "blah")

to print blah in the IDE. If I run LW as a console, it works.

On Win32 I've tried allocating a console:

(fli:define-foreign-function (alloc-console "AllocConsole")
    ())

(alloc-console)

and a text console popped-up, but I'm lost of how to connect
*terminal-io*, *debug-io* or any output to it.

Actually I was able to get it, and with combination of it and using
the FAR manager it's doable, but I wonder if something better could be
done.
Here is how:

lispworks-6-0-0-x86-win32 1&gtone.txt 2&gttwo.txt

then keepeing far.exe browsing one.txt (it keeps scrolling). Weird but works.

Maybe on the Mac there would be a solution like this one.
