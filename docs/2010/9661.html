                <h1>shrink vector and setf expansion</h1>
                <pre>
Hello Lispers,

1) I want to shrink a vector (string). Looking at the source code of
puri.lisp from franz inc, I found that for Lispwork they used this
undocumented function:

system::shrink-vector$vector

Is it a legitimate use? Or is it better to use subseq to get a shorter
string from the original? Any other options to shrink a vector
(adjust-array, for example)?


2) I have these simple lines:

(defparameter a 0)
(setf a 1)

In some sources it is said that for such a case the macroexapnd of
setf should be simple (setq a 1), but Lispworks does something like
this:

(LET* ((#:G684 1)) (SETQ A #:G684))

What is the rationale behind this (let form)? Just curious. :)


Best,
 Art

It is not recommended to use the symbols that are not exported and not
documented. Though they works anyhow :-). OTOH, adjust-array is only
applicable to adjustable vectors, which are treated slower than simple
vectors.

If you are in doubt, you can take a look at another portable URI
implementation (not using system::shrink-vector$vector) at http://lisp.ystok.ru/projects.html#yuri

Do not worry, I believe the compiler should optimize and strips away this
"let" afterwards.

My guess is that this is some residual artifact of the SETF expansion  
avoiding multiple evaluation.  In any case it will almost certainly be  
optimized away. I don't think you have any guarantee of what the  
expansion of SETF will be (unless it's one you've defined): rather you  
know that it will have certain properties (evaluating things only  
once, returning the new value, probably some others), which this  
clearly does.
