                <h1>FLI problem, maybe because of nested structs</h1>
                <pre>
Hi everybody,

I'm trying to interface to some C code and I'm having problems with
one particular function call.  I usually get "Exception C0000005"
which I seem to remember means that some pointer or address is
mis-interpreted.  One argument to the function is a struct within a
struct and I /think/ that this must be the culprit, but I can't figure
out where exactly the problem is.  Here's what I've done (on Windows
XP with LWW 5.1):

The relevant simple C type definitions are these

  typedef unsigned short TW_UINT16;
  typedef unsigned long  TW_UINT32;
  typedef LPVOID  TW_MEMREF;
  typedef char    TW_STR32[34];

which I've translated like this:

  (define-c-typedef dword :unsigned-long)
  (define-c-typedef handle dword)
  (define-c-typedef tw-str32 (:ef-mb-string :limit 34 :null-terminated-p t))

(The TW_MEMREF argument is, in this particular case, used to hand over
a window handle, so in my code below I don't user :POINTER but rather
HANDLE.)

Now the two structs:

  typedef struct {
     TW_UINT16  MajorNum;
     TW_UINT16  MinorNum;
     TW_UINT16  Language;
     TW_UINT16  Country;
     TW_STR32   Info;
  } TW_VERSION;

  typedef struct {
     TW_UINT32  Id;
     TW_VERSION Version;
     TW_UINT16  ProtocolMajor;
     TW_UINT16  ProtocolMinor;
     TW_UINT32  SupportedGroups;
     TW_STR32   Manufacturer;
     TW_STR32   ProductFamily;
     TW_STR32   ProductName;
  } TW_IDENTITY, FAR * pTW_IDENTITY;

And here's my Lisp version of them:

  (define-c-struct tw-version
    (major-num :unsigned-short)
    (minor-num :unsigned-short)
    (language :unsigned-short)
    (country :unsigned-short)
    (info tw-str32))

  (define-c-struct tw-identity
    (id :unsigned-long)
    (version tw-version)
    (protocol-major :unsigned-short)
    (protocol-minor :unsigned-short)
    (supported-groups :unsigned-long)
    (manufacturer tw-str32)
    (product-family tw-str32)
    (product-name tw-str32))

Does this look right?  Could there be a problem with alignment that
I'm missing?  FWIW, the header file is supposed to be understood by
various compilers including Microsoft's.

Here, finally is the function:

  TW_UINT16 FAR PASCAL DSM_Entry( pTW_IDENTITY pOrigin,
                                  pTW_IDENTITY pDest,
                                  TW_UINT32    DG,
                                  TW_UINT16    DAT,
                                  TW_UINT16    MSG,
                                  TW_MEMREF    pData);

I've searched a bit and my understanding is that both FAR and PASCAL
are compatibility decorations which are needed for 16-bit Windows but
are ignored on 32-bit platforms.

Here's the Lisp definition:

  (define-foreign-function (dsm-entry "DSM_Entry")
      ((p-origin :pointer)
       (p-dest :pointer)
       (dg :unsigned-long)
       (dat :unsigned-short)
       (msg :unsigned-short)
       (p-data handle))
    :calling-convention :cdecl
    :result-type :unsigned-short)

Does anyone spot anything that I could have done wrong?

Thanks,
Edi.

Hi Martin,

Thanks a lot for your quick replies.  That gives me something to think
about and try and I'll report back to the list.

About the alignment problem, I thought I had looked for a "pack"
pragma in the header file, but I now checked again and it turns out I
hadn't or I overlooked it.  D'oh!!!

And, yes, I first had :stdcall in there but changed it because I
thought that might have been the problem.  I rarely look at C code and
usually only if I need to interface to it from Lisp.  I'm sure someone
more familiar with it and with the standard compilers would have seen
the problem immediately.

Thanks again,
Edi.

&gt&gt &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;TW_STR32 &nbsp; ProductName;
&gt&gt &nbsp; } TW_IDENTITY, FAR * pTW_IDENTITY;
&gt&gt
&gt&gt And here's my Lisp version of them:
&gt&gt
&gt&gt &nbsp; (define-c-struct tw-version
&gt&gt &nbsp; &nbsp; (major-num :unsigned-short)
&gt&gt &nbsp; &nbsp; (minor-num :unsigned-short)

&gt&gt &nbsp; &nbsp; (manufacturer tw-str32)
&gt&gt &nbsp; &nbsp; (product-family tw-str32)
&gt&gt &nbsp; &nbsp; (product-name tw-str32))
&gt&gt
&gt&gt Does this look right?
&gt
&gt Yes, but it would be easier to check if you use define-c-typedef to define
&gt TW_UINT16 and TW_UINT32 and then use those wherever C does.
&gt
&gt
&gt&gt &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Could there be a problem with alignment that
&gt&gt I'm missing? &nbsp;FWIW, the header file is supposed to be understood by
&gt&gt various compilers including Microsoft's.
&gt
&gt Yes, that could be the problem. &nbsp;I found
&gt http://twainmodule.sourceforge.net/docs/lowlevel.html which says:
&gt
&gt "Note: The TWAIN standard pack values to two byte boundaries. In normal C
&gt structures there is a padding of two bytes before SupportedGroups. However, in
&gt the TWAIN interface there is none."
&gt
&gt Does the header file mention "pack" anywhere (e.g. #pragma pack)?
&gt
&gt If the whole file uses 2 byte packing then you need to add (:byte-packing 2)
&gt before the slots in all of the structs.
&gt
&gt
&gt&gt Here, finally is the function:
&gt&gt
&gt&gt &nbsp; TW_UINT16 FAR PASCAL DSM_Entry( pTW_IDENTITY pOrigin,
&gt&gt &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pTW_IDENTITY pDest,
&gt&gt &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TW_UINT32 &nbsp; &nbsp;DG,
&gt&gt &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TW_UINT16 &nbsp; &nbsp;DAT,
&gt&gt &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TW_UINT16 &nbsp; &nbsp;MSG,
&gt&gt &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TW_MEMREF &nbsp; &nbsp;pData);
&gt&gt
&gt&gt I've searched a bit and my understanding is that both FAR and PASCAL
&gt&gt are compatibility decorations which are needed for 16-bit Windows but
&gt&gt are ignored on 32-bit platforms.
&gt&gt
&gt&gt Here's the Lisp definition:
&gt&gt
&gt&gt &nbsp; (define-foreign-function (dsm-entry "DSM_Entry")
&gt&gt &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ((p-origin :pointer)
&gt&gt &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(p-dest :pointer)
&gt&gt &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(dg :unsigned-long)
&gt&gt &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(dat :unsigned-short)
&gt&gt &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(msg :unsigned-short)
&gt&gt &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(p-data handle))
&gt&gt &nbsp; &nbsp; :calling-convention :cdecl
&gt&gt &nbsp; &nbsp; :result-type :unsigned-short)
&gt&gt
&gt&gt Does anyone spot anything that I could have done wrong?
&gt
&gt PASCAL expands to __stdcall in VC++, so I think it should be
&gt :calling-convention :stdcall.

OK, as promised: So far it seems to work fine.  The explicit packing
was necessary as was the stdcall calling convention about which Martin
was right, i.e. Visual Studio indeed translates PASCAL to stdcall.  I
also made another dumb mistake which cost me some additional time, but
I'd rather not mention this here... :)

Thanks,
Edi.
