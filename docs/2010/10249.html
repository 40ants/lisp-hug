                <pre>
Hi,

This may be interesting for LispWorks users: I am going to give a tutorial on parallel programming in Common Lisp at the European Lisp Symposium, which takes place in Lisbon, Portugal on May 6-7, 2010. While I will try to give a general overview of the field, including the various parallel programming approaches, I will primarily use the multiprocessing facilities of LispWorks as examples. The reason is that I consider the support for SMP in LispWorks as the most advanced and most well-thought out one of the Common Lisp implementations I checked (including Clozure and SBCL, but not yet Allegro Common Lisp, who don't offer SMP yet, so their APIs may still change considerably - at least that's what I would expect), and maybe even of any Lisp dialect (yes, including Clojure ;).

Here is the link for the symposium: http://www.european-lisp-symposium.org/


Cheers,
Pascal

&gtHi Pascal,
&gt
&gtWill your tutorial be available online for those of us who can't go to Lisbon?
&gt
&gtI would be interested to hear what you consider essential and 
&gtimportant regarding SMP primitives and API.


Video or audio of your presentation, Pascal, *would* be great!.

I also wish that I were able to be in Lisbon in May but, alas, it is 
not "in the cards".

Will you mention any of the old classic approaches from long ago in a 
galaxy far away - Gabriel and McCarthy's Qlambda, Halstead's 
MultiLisp, TMI's *Lisp, or even some of the message-passing things 
that ran on the now extinct Transputers?

Hi Pascal,

I'm with the others who cannot attend. Please make this available in some  
form for those of us who cannot be at ELS.

Thanks,

William
