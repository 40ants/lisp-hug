                <h1>Entering #\Tab in a CAPI:MULTI-LINE-TEXT-INPUT-PANE on Windows</h1>
                <pre>
Hi all,

I'd gotten used to the behavior of the capi:multi-line-text-input-pane
on OS X wherein #\Tab puts in a literal #\Tab character, and it takes
a Control-Tab to get the focus to move to the next pane.  In fact, it
was kind of handy for writing things with a bit of alignment in their
structure.

Now I've moved over to Windows, and I can't figure out how to put a
#\Tab character into a multi-line-text-input-pane.  Pressing #\Tab
changes the focus, and the various modifiers+Tab switch between
applications or windows.  Anyone know how to put a #\Tab in a
multi-line-text-input-pane?

Many thanks in advance!

//JT

Just press and hold ALT then type 0, 9 on the numeric keypad. This technique
was mentioned frequently in DOS textbooks but seems to miss from Windows.

BTW, you can always enter the carriage return in m-l-t-p by pressing
Control+Enter on Windows.
