Thanks.

What about environments (variable-information, augment-information and  
friends)?

So I'm guess there will NOT be a patch release to fix the glitches that OS X Snow Leopard has with 5.1?

Hi Dave,

These are exciting news! I have just checked, and it is indeed the case that the site license for our university got renewed. Thanks a lot for that.

However, I also have a personal copy on my name for which I believed I renewed the maintenance contract regularly. Unfortunately, it seems that I haven't received a renewal notice in 2009 and haven't thought about renewing the license myself. Is there anything we can still do about it?

The last renewal notice I received was from September 3rd, 2008.

Best,
Pascal
