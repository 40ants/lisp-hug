                <h1>Getting Swank-server working in a Delivered Lispworks (Win32) EXE</h1>
                <pre>
I am on Win32. . . Lispworks 6 (have 5.1 handy still though)

I'm not asking about Emacs-&gtLW via Slime.

And I have Emacs-&gtSwank server working when the Lisp environment is
running in the IDE, so the Emacs configuration and connectivity is good.

However, the IDE can call Compile-file. . . .  a delivered .EXE cannot.

Perhaps my configuration for swank and swank-server is incorrect; but
when swank-server takes an inbound connection it attempts to
compile-file a few of its contribs to a secondary location (some user
subdirectory).  So the delivered EXE has Swank compiled into it; but it
tries to late-compile things when you try to connect (in Slime-connect
you see the callstacks of these failed compilation attempts, i.e.
connection works, swank works; but it gets held up on its contribs).

My attempts to call into Swank to get it to compile/load these in
advance cause the Delivery mechanism (run from the command line) to pop
open an IDE that's just blank.

I was wondering if anyone has a turn-key solution for this already. 
Knowing that it is possible at all would make it worth my digging for a
solution.  Knowing if it is impossible will prevent me from burning any
more time on this. 


Thanks in advance,
Matt

How do you load swank? 

Try

  (load "swank-loader.lisp")
  (swank-loader:init :setup t :load-contribs t)

  -T.
