                <h1>Accessing the Windows message pump from LW/CAPI</h1>
                <pre>
And here's a second question, not directly related to my previous one:

The C library I'm interfacing to is meant to be used in such a way
that a Windows programming talking with it has to modify the Windows
message pump.  It has to call GetMessage, inspect the message to see
if it's for the library and hand it over, and only send all other
(i.e. normal) messages to the usual TranslateMessage, DispatchMessage
mechanism.

This is, I think, something than can't be done in CAPI.  What I came
up with is the following: I start a new ("worker") thread which
creates (using Win32 functions directly) a new hidden window and then
establishes its own message pump which it also uses to communicate
with the rest of the program.

Does this sound feasible or does anybody expect a problem there?  Am I
right to assume that if a new thread creates its own window that it
gets its own message queue from Windows which CAPI won't interfer with
because I'm not using CAPI in this thread?  Or is this approach
doomed?

Or is there a much better and elegant way to hook into the message
pump in CAPI?

Thanks,
Edi.

Raymond, did you mean to register-module the Win32 library, or were
you talking about other, third-party C libs?

Thanks,
Edi.

That was very helpful and something I wasn't aware of before.  This
indeed looks more elegant to me than my own approach.

Thanks a lot, I'll try this.

This all works fine as long as the window is visible.  But if I create
the window with the win32:ws_visible flag not set, it doesn't work
anymore.  It seems to me as if messages are not sent to invisible
windows.  Is that true?  Maybe someone with more knowledge about
Windows can enlighten me?

Thanks,

That is unexpected, in particular because DDE and COM/Automation both use
invisible windows to pass messages between application.

Have you tried using Spy++ to watch the messages?

Is the window enabled (it should be by default)?

OK, that means it definitely should work which is an important piece
of information.

Heh, until now I didn't even know that I had it on my hard disk.  I'll
run some tests and report back.

I didn't disabled it explicitly, but I'll double-check.

Thanks again for your help,
Edi.

Which I'm doing now for the sake of completeness: The funny thing was
that the invisible window didn't receive messages but started to
receive them once I monitored it with Spy++.  Which - after some
head-scratching - helped me figure out that I had a race condition in
my code.  In other words: Spy++ slowed down the whole process just
enough to make the race condition disappear.

Looks like this is solved and I'm off to the next problem.

Thanks,
Edi.
