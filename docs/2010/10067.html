                <h1>capi:menu-items don't know their item or choice?</h1>
                <pre>
I'm getting a rather strange error on LW6 (Windows).  I'm defining
some interfaces with menus whose items are computed dynamically, and
the menu items behave just fine if they're selected with the mouse,
but have problems when invoked via an accelerator.  E.g.,

(in-package "CL-USER")

(capi:define-interface testing () ()
  (:menus
   (foo "Foo" () :items-function 'foo-menu-items))
  (:menu-bar foo))

(defun foo-menu-items (&amp;rest args)
  (list (make-instance
         'capi:menu-item
         :text "Bar" :accelerator #\N
         :callback #'(lambda (&amp;rest cargs)
                       (capi:display-message "~A ~A" args cargs)))))

(capi:display (make-instance 'testing))

If I display the interface and press Control-Shift-N (before clicking
on the "Foo" menu), the callback happens without a problem.  If I then
click on the "Foo" menu, or click on it first, and select the "Bar"
item, the callback happens just fine.  But if I press Control-Shift-N
after having shown the menu by clicking on "Foo", I get an error
"Callback with both item and choice not capi objects : NIL / NIL".  Is
there some other argument I should have been passing to the
items-function?  I know that there's a setup-callback-argument, but I
don't see any convenient way to pass it the choice (the menu, I
assume), and I'm just not clear why the item isn't the menu item (and
hence a capi object).

The same code works without a hitch on OS X.

Anyone know what's going on here?  I'd really like to be able to use
accelerators in LW in my application…

Many thanks in advance!  //JT

I have got the same on LWW 4.4.6.

As workaround, I would not recommend defining accelerators for dynamically
computed items. Anyway, it is rather confusing when the accelerator only
works after expanding the menu by another means at least once.

&gt depending on context.  E.g., there's a "Delete Item" (enabled) menu
&gt item if the selection is a single item, a "Delete Item" (disabled)
&gt menu item if there is no selection, and a "Delete Items" (enabled)
&gt menu item if there are ≥2 things in the selection.  I'm not clear how

You can have changing menu-items without replacing them: Use NIL for
:text, and use a :print-function to print the menu item.

In general, dynamic menu items can't have accelerators because the accelerator
gesture has to be connected to the item before the parent menu pops up.
Likewise, the end user has to know what the accelerator will do without seeing
the menu.

The only case where it is allowed is when you return the same capi:menu-item
objects each time the :items-function is called.  That works because the
accelerator is still connected to that item.
