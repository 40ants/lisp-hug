                <h1>Windows error on launch of delivered application.</h1>
                <pre>
Despite extensive beta testing now that our product is released I'm
getting a report from some of our Windows users. When our delivered
application is launched, a Windows error dialog opens up with the
following message:

Failed to reserve 51052544 bytes of memory (preferred address 0x1ffe0000)
Error 487: Attempt to access invalid address.


50 MB is about the size of our delivered application.  Built with
LispWorks 5.1

Does anyone recognize this? And, better, know what is needed?

Chris -- Can you find out the version of Windows under which the 
failure is occurring??

For example, Windows "Embedded" - which can be non-paging - can show 
this sort of error if not enough DRAM is available.

Not entirely related to Lisp, but we found out that on certain of our
machines, people do install various hooks (ICQ, Skype, Antivirus) that
would put their DLL's into the application user space.

To avoid that, we had to force these DLL's to be rebased somehow by
the System. What we did (which I'm not sure whether LispWorks can do)
was to have a big .BSS section (for example static char
blah[128*1024*1024]) - and reuse that as a memory (for example make
the Doug Lea's dlmalloc use that area). Obviously not great solution,
but worked for us.

Isn't there something for rebasing stuff in Lispworks, or reserving
..BSS space in the executable for Lispworks?
