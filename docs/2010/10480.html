Hi all,

As some of you will have guessed from my questions on this list in the
last days, I've been working on a library that connects TWAIN
(www.twain.org) to LispWorks.  This work has been partially sponsored
so far by a valuable member of this list.

What we have by now is a working prototype which you can load into LWW
to give you Lisp functions to select a scanner, instruct it to scan an
image or parts of it, and to have this image available for example to
display it in CAPI.

What remains to be done is some polishing and documentation.  What
could be added is Mac or Linux support.  Plus, there are lots of
options in TWAIN to control various parts of the image acquisition
process that haven't been implemented yet but would probably be nice
to have for certain Lisp apps.

The current plan is to eventually release this as an open source
library.  When this will happen and how much and what will be
implemented depends on my spare time, though.

I'm writing this to figure out if someone else here might be
interested in such a library and would be willing to sponsor some of
its development in order to speed up its release and/or to add more
features than it currently has.

If this applies to you, please contact me off list.

Thanks,
Edi.
