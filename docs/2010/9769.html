Some of the students (plus myself)  here in a high school where I teach are looking forward to seeing this text.  I've liked programming with Lisp for many years, but sometimes it's a "hard sell" to the youth today, Python often takes precedence.  Please keep us informed about when your book's coming out.
Thanks,
Randy Latimer

    &gt We're look forward to the paper you're writing. ;)

    And the chapter in your book? ;)

Well, the MP chapter's already written.

 http://lisp-book.org/contents/ch15.html

Fwiw it's in the ACL "section" of the book (which doesn't mean I can't
mention other implementations but does imply some sort of focus). Even
though I'm over budget on pages, the SMP section is woefully short and
needs expanding.

Right now I'd say David's work still counts as active research -
brilliant stuff - but not quite ready for the book I'm working
on. "When the music stops", if I come across a summary which I can
read and really understand in short order, I might well write about
it.
