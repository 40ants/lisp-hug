&gt I typed at listener:
&gt (proclaim '(optimize (speed 0) (space 0) (safety 3) (debug 3)  (float 1)))
&gt but still can't set the breakpoint.

Just re-evaluate the defining form where you want to set the breakpoint
(Meta-Ctrl-x inside the top-level form, or Ctrl-x Ctrl-e with point just
after the form).


&gt Here is the example:
&gt "here I can set the breakpoint -&gt"(defvar *pics*
&gt '("c:/pics/parovi01.jpg"))

Why would you set a breakpoint there? Setting a breakpoint implies you
want to interrupt evaluation partway through during a function or macro
call. How will you call the defvar form (unless the defvar is inside a
function or macro definition?) to "reach" your breakpoint?


&gt "here I can't with message 'No definition found' -&gt"(setf *pics*
&gt ("c:/pics/parovi01.jpg"))
&gt Maybe breakpoint at this place is unsettable ?

You can set breakpoints on all forms except atomic and constant forms:
http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw60/IDE-U/html/ide-u-506.htm
Where did you try to place it? You need to set it on either the opening
or closing parenthesis of the non-constant form - just don't set it on
the opening or closing parenthesis of the top-level (outer-most) form.

&gt I rewrote a function in Lispworks with about 10 forms
&gt and I can set breakpoint on every form.
&gt I loaded previouslly the code with that function
&gt which I wrote in Emacs.
&gt Lispworks obviously has problems with code written
&gt somewhere else. Maybe it's some kind of bug.

Every now and then I move code between Emacs/Slime and the LispWorks IDE
without any problems. I have also placed breakpoints in libraries which
I know were not written with the LispWorks editor. I have come across
situations where I could not place a breakpoint, but re-evaluating the
function/macro always fixed it for me. If you can duplicate the problem,
please submit a bug report to help improve LispWorks.

Regards.
