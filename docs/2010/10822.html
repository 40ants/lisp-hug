                <h1>Initial window size</h1>I have a situation that seem to bump into a lot that I always kludge around, so I figured it&#39;s about time to ask the experts for the right way to do this.<br><br>The situation is, I have a window that includes a pane that I think of as the main pane of the window. When I first create the window, I want the main pane to be a certain size.  I.e. I want the initial window size to be such that, when the window lays itself out on the normal way it lays itself out, the main pane will end up being of a specified size.  But after the window is created, the pane should be fully resizable.<br>

<br>When I know the desired pane size early enough, I&#39;ve set the min and max hints to that size in the initialize-instance method for  the pane, and then set them to nil (or whatever actual limits I want) in the create callback.  The initial window size seems to be decided somewhere between those two points, so this works out ok, but it feels kludgy.<br>

<br>Plus now I have a situation where I to need to be further along before I can compute the initial size -- I need to look at fonts and images, and those aren&#39;t available yet in initialize-instance method.  I can compute the desired main pane size in the create callback, but then what?<br>
