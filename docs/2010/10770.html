Thank you everybody for the replies! The reason why I asked was mostly that to me the use of error handling facilities in that example seemed "not the right way". Before posting I googled the Internet and found even this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/354038/how-do-i-check-if-a-string-is-a-number-in-python where using "try-catch" was praised which to me still looks weired in such an example no matter what the language.

And yes, the second example with handler-case (or ignore-errors) is actually slower around 4 times if you test it with "bad" data (like "123a"). Thanks to those who pointed that to me.

Best,
 Art

You could also have looked at the meta-parse-number.lisp file in
Ystok-Library.
