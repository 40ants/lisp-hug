                <h1>How to quit</h1>
                <pre>
I'm writing a CAPI application that reads a data file and displays it  
in a document window to allow you to edit it.

I've defined a confirm-destroy-function for the interface that  
prompts the user to save any changes before closing the document  
window, and that works fine.

However, when testing the application under the LispWorks IDE,  
choosing Quit from the LispWorks window seems to close my document  
window without respecting the confirm-destroy-function.

Is there something I'm doing wrong? Or do I need to add actions to  
the LispWorks "When quitting image" action list to do a destroy- 
interface on my document window?

Thanks for any advice,
David Johnson-Davies

Capi:destroy ignores the confirm-destroy-function, and
capi:quit-interface is permitted to (with a :force argument).  I was
going to suggest that, since both capi:destroy and capi:quit-interface
use capi:destroy, an :around method on capi:destroy might be an easy
way to get what you want, but it doesn't work (I tried).

I think that you were on the right track with the action lists, but
even better than "When quitting image" would be the "Confirm when
quitting image" list.

(This was actually really great timing;  I need to do the same thing
in an application on which I'm working, and this was a good prompting
to find out how.  Thanks!)

Hope this helps, //JT

Just call quit in the destroy-callback.

If you plan to deliver your application, another solution is possible. Put
:quit-when-no-windows t in the delivery script. The latter is more
convenient on debug stage as you do not exit the IDE on closing your window.
