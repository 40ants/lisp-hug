                <h1>(LW-HUG) Copy Protection for Delivered Systems...</h1>
                <pre>
Greetings to the Group --

I have been looking at the SG-Lock device -- built by SG Intec of 
Kiel, Germany (http://www.sg-lock.com/en/index.php) -- as a possible 
inexpensive way to protect "delivered" Lisp application systems from 
surreptitious copying etc.

The SG-Lock is a small USB "dongle" device that has an internal 
processor and FLASH memory that is able to encipher/decipher data 
using TEA (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Encryption_Algorithm) as 
the base block cipher algorithm.

My interest is to make it "difficult" for someone to simply make off 
with a commercial application coded in Lisp and "deliver"ed as an 
Application.exe (in Windows).  We build a system that lives in custom 
embedded hardware and so such a dongle would be "inside the box" and 
not something that the user would have to "fiddle around with".

Best that I can tell, the SG-Lock is not really cryptographically 
secure in the sense of "hiding" a secret key in protected hardware 
(e.g., NIST FIPS 140-2/4) as the key is just downloaded and lives in 
FLASH memory on the dongle which is fairly easy to recover (break the 
physical thing open and look at it with one means or the other (I 
used to do a vaguely similar thing decades ago with 1/2-inch magnetic 
tape and a few drops of alcohol with a suspension of fine powdered 
iron -- hordes of little magnetized iron stripes would appear as the 
alcohol dried -- 800 to the inch in those ancient days -- the real 
fun was to decode, under a microscope, what they meant in the NRZ 
encoding used  :))

In addition, the SG-Lock device uses TEA for the encipherment 
algorithm which is not, best that I can tell, all that secure (in a 
formal certified crypto sense).

However, there is an old saying: "How much security do you need 
anyway?"    Answer - "As much as you can afford."

....and I *can* afford the SG-Lock at about $30 USD :)

There are several obvious ways to proceed:

(a)  Simply encipher (in part or in whole) the Application.exe 
(Windows) file before shipping with a unique key using TEA and 
download that key to the SG-Lock. At power-up, have an intermediary 
program that deciphers the Application.exe file with the SG-Lock 
device loaded with the key and supplied to the user and then start 
the deciphered Application.exe. Problem:  If someone had access to 
the enciphered Application.exe and the SG-Lock, they could easily 
(well, if only partially enciphered, easilyish) decipher the file and 
copy that and use it - spread it about etc.

(b) Have the Application.exe call the SG-Lock during startup and do 
some simple "crypto thing" and then return the symbol :proceed if all 
is well or nil if not and stop. Problem: With a bit more reverse 
engineering, one could simply NOP out the dongle check (scan for 
assembly that leaps into the Windows USB driver thingus or, even 
better, just replace the .dll supplied by SG-Lock with your own that 
always returns :proceed).  Simple.

(c) Similar others come to mind...   ...and they are no better.


The fundamental problem is that the SG-Lock is not able to securely 
store a secret key (what do you expect for $30? I am not criticizing).

There is no way that I see to ever make this system 
"cryptographically secure" -- especially in a way 
transparent/acceptable to users (i.e., no unique pass phrases etc).

There are procedures and things in the SG-Lock .dll/library that do 
things like provide a requirement to initialize the .dll with a long 
"customer id" etc - but those would be fairly easy to get around with 
some reasonably good hack work - Clearly(ish), any half-decent 
mechanism will depend on the TEA encipherment.

Perhaps the device could be used at run-time -- for example, what if 
I were to (somehow - an exercise for the student) TEA encipher a few 
key/critical Lisp application functions (compiled code of course out 
on the heap on the development PC) with a unique key just before the 
system is being "Delivered". When the Application.exe system starts 
up, part of the start-up sequence would be to decipher the several 
functions using the supplied SG-Lock and the unique key and replace 
them with the deciphered versions on-the-fly.

Still not "cryptographically secure", of course -- really "security 
by obfuscation" but it *would* be a bit more difficult to get through 
as everything would happen within the dynamic Lisp system and not 
just with static files on the disk - on the other hand, perhaps that 
just makes it easier... (however, there would be no symbol names, or 
compiler, or delivery mechanism in place - just 50mb of RAM - it 
might actually be fairly difficult to duplicate the deciphered system 
- e.g., how do you "deliver" an already "deliver"ed system...).

Any thoughts on this......  ...especially by someone that knows more 
than I do about the internal structure of LW.

ps - It might be interesting to see what the GC might make of an 
enciphered function - might work and might not :)

Just checking before you re-invent the wheel - you know about the
CL-DONGLE library, don't you?

In applications secured with an SG-Lock dongle I've done some or all
of the following things:

1. The application checks for the presence of a dongle at application
startup and whenever certain "strategic" functions are called.

2. Optionally, the application can check for a specific dongle (based
on its serial number) so that the executable is tied to this one
dongle.

3. The main application loop is started by a kind of "computed jump"
(a simulated FLI call) and the encrypted target address is only
decrypted at application startup using a key which is hidden in the
dongle.

4. A limited (by the dongle's memory size) number of crucial values is
modified before the delivered executable is created.  The original
values are restored from the dongle's internal memory at startup time.

5. A (potentially unlimited) number of values is encrypted (and thus
rendered useless) when the executable is created.  The correct values
are decrypted using a hidden dongle key at startup time.

Of course, as you said all of this can be broken in one way or the
other.  The question just is how hard this would be and if there's
someone with enough time, cleverness, expertise, and energy to do it.

HTH,
Edi.

I am no expert in this, but I've made a few reflections on the subject.
The 'check and then go ahead and run it' approach can easily be hacked.
You set a debugger to trap when some global data is altered, you look at
the stack to see what called it and disassemble. Then you nop out the
corresponding bytes that checks your pass-phrase and presto no check.

The best way is to encrypt the entire program and then decrypt it in
memory using the key in your doogle. The pass-phrase the is the thing
encrypted in TEA. For your own program use 3DES, IDEA or Blowfish.
Public key encryption is too slow using stock hardware and should only
be used for key's. 
And make sure to disable the ability to dump core.

Secondly there is no reason to tell anyone about the doogle. Security
through obscurity works remarkably well. If the don't know about it they
won't be looking for it will they? (I also use Chrome insted of Firefox
on the world wild web for the same reason.. Few people bother putting a
lot of effort hacking obscure browsers.) Hardly cryptographically
secure, but it mostly works. Chances are the real hacker won't have
access to the hardware, he will just have and insider give him a copy of
the software.

Hope I gave you a few ideas.

John

Edi -- I just now tracked down your CL-DONGLE library - Nice work indeed.

I see your point (4) - to encipher certain "critical items" and store 
them on the dongle and then retrieve/decipher the items at 
run-time/startup and restore the "critical items" in the executing image.

I had not thought of that - enciphering/storing, for example, certain 
integers (addresses?) etc that the application depends on.

Well, actually I guess that I sort of did -- I was thinking of 
enciphering an entire "critical function" (compiled Lisp) with the 
dongle - deciphering that and restoring it at run-time.

This sort of thing is, of course, a fine line to walk - it is 
inherently not secure as it just obfuscates the situation to make it 
not worthwhile to get through the obscurity.

I still like the idea of enciphering a compiled Lisp function and 
then deciphering that with the dongle at startup. I think that is the 
path that I will take - all that I will need will be the dongle with 
just the TEA crypto engine and not any of the flash memory, which, if 
nothing else, will save $10 USD or so of COGS.

....and, it will be interesting to see exactly how to do that -

ps - Sorry for the delay in responding, but I have been out of town 
on business etc.

Exactly.

....or AES-256.

Yes, I agree but the thing I am struggling with is how to (simply) 
encipher a delivered image (application.exe under windows) and have 
that successfully load by the O/S - clearly, none of it (.exe headers 
etc) will make any sense to the O/S.

That is the primary reason that I am thinking of enciphering just a 
single "critical" compiled Lisp function which would be part of the 
delivered image. At run-time, decipher that "critical" Lisp function 
(compiled, of course) and replace it.

....and, of course, you are correct about using the slow external 
dongle hardware to just handle a block cipher key and then using the 
1.6Ghz faster target hardware (this is an embedded system) to handle 
the bulk of the crypto.

You certainly have.
