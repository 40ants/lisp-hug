the value for direction is :output.

read the hyperspec documentation for with-open-file &lt;http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_w_open.htm&gt

                 <h1>Re: newbie question</h1><div>In case you are wondering why use symbols instead of string, when dealing with a very limited number of accepted arguments to a function using symbols instead of strings can represent an advantage.<i> </i>If dealing with literal strings (the ones you type like &quot;foo&quot; on the REPL for instance) when they are evaluated a new string instance is created even if the same sequence of characters are used, for instance:</div>
<div><br></div><div>CL-USER&gt; (print-object &quot;sample string&quot; *standard-output*)</div><div><div><div>#&lt;(SIMPLE-ARRAY CHARACTER (13)) {1003787A0F}&gt;</div><div>NIL</div></div><div><br></div><div>CL-USER&gt; (print-object &quot;sample-string&quot; *standard-output*)</div>
<div><div>#&lt;(SIMPLE-ARRAY CHARACTER (13)) {1003AF664F}&gt;</div><div>NIL</div><div><br></div><div>This small example shows that for every time you call that form a new object is created for the &quot;sample string&quot;, you can notice this by looking at the address for the object in memory and how it is different between the two evaluations {1003787A0F} and {1003AF664F}. Now symbols behave quite differently, when you try to evaluate a symbol (in any given package) the system will check if a symbol instance by that name exists already and will return that instance if it already exists in memory, only creating a new instance if that symbol was never evaluated in the running image (or probably if it has been garbage-collected). Let&#39;s repeat the previous example:</div>
<div><br></div><div>CL-USER&gt; (print-object :sample *standard-output*)</div><div><div>#&lt;KEYWORD {10037C36EF}&gt;</div><div>NIL</div></div><div><br></div></div></div><div>CL-USER&gt; (print-object :sample *standard-output*)</div>
<div><div>#&lt;KEYWORD {10037C36EF}&gt;</div><div>NIL</div><div><br></div></div><div>Now as you can see the memory address is exactly the same meaning that even if you call this function a zillion times only one instance of the object will need to be created, this means that the system won&#39;t have to spend so much time allocating memory (and later garbage-collecting it) everytime you call that function.</div>
<div><br></div><div>Just my 2 cents on using symbols as function parameters, sorry to everyone if i&#39;m not entirely correct on all i&#39;ve written, this is how i see it but i might be somewhat wrong.</div><div><br></div>
<div>Cheers,</div><div><br></div><div>Alex</div><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Sat, Feb 6, 2010 at 4:57 PM, Aleksandar Matijaca <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:amatijaca@gmail.com">amatijaca@gmail.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>
