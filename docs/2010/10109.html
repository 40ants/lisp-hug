Possibly I can use image copying for parts of the scrolling, but a  
difficulty is that I draw a note head when a "note on" event arrives  
and later when the corresponding "note off" event arrives, I change  
the note head (now scrolled to the left) into its right shape  
(quarter note, half note etc).

Anyway, I have made some progress. I stuffed all drawing and also  
updates using set-horizontal-scroll-parameters into with-atomic- 
redisplay and now have a smoother scroll.

I lack understanding of the underpinnings of updating the pane though...
-I realize that calls to invalidate-rectangle, queue up calls to the  
display-callback and that some of these calls are thrown away. But  
what calls are thrown away?
-What happens when calling set-horizontal-scroll-parameters? It  
doesn't seem to call invalidate-rectangle and even if I don't call  
invalidate-rectangle after set-horizontal-scroll-parameters, things  
are redrawn.
Are the above things described somewhere?

Thanks again!
/Sven

pane-update) every 20ms. This updating function changes the :max- 
range of the horizontal scroll-bar using capi:set-horizontal- 
scroll-parameters followed by a "scroll :horizontal :move :end",  
and then calls the display-callback function (display-note-pane).  
The idea is to set the slug in its right-most position, so that  
score notes enter the note-pane from the right and scroll to the  
left.
In the display-callback function, I have wrapped the drawing  
inside a with-atomic-redisplay.
Note:
The score notes displayed will change during scrolling, so I have  
to redraw them instead of just copying a bitmap.
Some observations:
-It works, but the drawing is not very smooth. It seems to jump a  
little back and forth while scrolling.
-When updating every 200ms instead, it looks OK, but slow.
</blockquote>Other sorts of capi animation I've done as well as apple's docs  
suggest that you'll never get more than 60fps screen refresh from a  
Cocoa/AppKit application. If you do much computation and drawing  
you'll start to see aliasing (e.g., wheels appearing to rotate  
backwards) even at 60fps. So 20ms=50fps is right on the edge of  
what is possible even with minimal computation and drawing per  
frame. Have you tried a 33ms timer (i.e., 30 fps)?
Another possibility: You could grab the already drawn notes in an  
image, draw that to the pane, then draw the new notes over it. For  
example, if you shift the notes by 1/10 of the visible pane width  
each frame, you grab the rightmost 9/10 of the pane in an image  
(gp:make-image-from-port), draw this image full left in the pane,  
then draw the new notes in the rightmost 1/10 of the pane.
Of course whether this would be faster than just redrawing is  
entirely dependent on how much redrawing you're doing. My  
benchmarks suggest that you can draw just under 200 polygons (i.e.,  
gp:draw-polygon) at 30 fps on a 2+GHz machine. Anything more than  
this and it's worthwhile to grab an image first, then do any new  
drawing for each frame over the grabbed image from the previous frame.
Something like this would do the side scrolling:
(defun anim-test-sidescroll (&amp;key (framerate 10) (time 6)) ;; up  
framerate to see effect
(declare (optimize speed (safety 1) (debug 0)))
(let* ((frame-x-offset 70) ;; how far we'll shift the pane  
contents left each frame
(circle-base-x-coordinate 600) ;; where we'll plunk down  
new circles
(current-image nil) ;; the image we've grabbed of the  
port, left end choppped
(old-image nil) ;; previous frame so we can free it and  
avoid a leak
(still-running t))
(labels ((display-a-frame (self x y width height)
(declare (ignorable x y width height))
(when current-image (gp:draw-image self current- 
image 0 0))
(dotimes (n 4) ;; draw 4 circles in a vertical line  
at the right edge
(gp:draw-circle self
(+ circle-base-x-coordinate (* n  
3)) ;; x
(+ 50 (* n 100) (random  
100))        ;; y
(+ 20 (random  
15))                   ;; radius
:filled t
:foreground (nth n  
'(:orange :blue :green :purple))))
(setf old-image current-image) ;; swap these cause  
we need a ref to old-image
(setf current-image ;; grab the current port  
contents with the left end chopped
(gp:make-image-from-port self frame-x-offset 0
;; need to truncate  
width  by frame-x-offset
;; or the image will  
be stretched when displayed
(- (gp:port-width  
self) frame-x-offset)
(gp:port-height self)))
(when old-image (gp:free-image self old-image))) ;;  
free the old image
(pane-destroyed (self) ;; stop the animation loop if  
pane goes bye bye
(declare (ignorable self))
(setf still-running nil)))
(let* ((the-pane ;; make a pane that uses the above func for  
display
(capi:contain
(make-instance 'capi:output-pane
:display-callback #'display- 
a-frame
:destroy-callback #'pane- 
destroyed)
:best-height 600 :best-width 700)))
(mp:process-run-function
"anim-test-sidescroll-process" ()
(lambda ()
(loop for i below (round (* framerate time))
while still-running do ;; loop for time  
redisplaying at framerate
(sleep (float (/ framerate) 1.0s0))
(gp:invalidate-rectangle the-pane))))))))
As you'll see if you experiment with the framerate keyword arg, you  
don't see any increase in speed beyond :framerate 60 -  
i.e., :framerate 300 looks just the same.
hth,
