Greetings to the List -

I thought this may be of interest - we have shipped First Product - a 
digital livescan fingerprint collection/management system.

You can see the system in action at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ti2q8eK0l58

Written, of course, completely in LispWorks :)

Amazing to think of these things running out there in the field on 
battery power - embedded real-time - happily consing and 
garbage-collecting away as we speak :)

How was it possible to run lispworks code on an embedded system, if you  
don't mind me asking?

Hello Yuri -

Good to hear from you.

It is actually "soft realtime/embedded", where we create a &lt;&gt.exe 
executable file that runs under the Windows XP Embedded ( 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_xp_embedded#Windows_XP_Embedded 
) operating system (we plan to move to Linux soon(ish) once some 
device driver issues are resolved).

The LispWorks Delivery mechanism is used to bundle everything up - 
including our application code and the LispWorks system itself - to 
create the &lt;&gt.exe file.

When Windows XP Embedded boots, it automatically executes our &lt;&gt.exe, 
which brings the Lisp system and our application to life.  So, when 
you power up the system, our application automatically comes up with, 
of course, the Lisp environment running underneith.

CAPI is used to handle all of the GUI issues.

The Delivery mechanism "shakes out" all of the unused pieces of the 
LispWorks environment as well as all symbols etc to end up with the 
smallest possible executable.

All of this is documented in the LispWorks Delivery manual.

Happy Regards,

Thanks Jack, it was quite enlightening to find out that Lispworks is not  
limited to run only on desktop systems and servers.

I think that was it, although I'd imagine running Lispworks on that  
hardware could be a little more complex than in Jack's case:)

Jack says, "Definitely" -

Worst case, I can actually break out the soldering iron and have a go 
at the hardware - or even attach an oscilloscope and watch the bits 
wander about...

Hard to do that when the processor board is bolted onto an ion engine 
and the whole thing is zipping along somewhere between Mars and Jupiter :)
