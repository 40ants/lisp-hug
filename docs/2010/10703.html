                <h1>LW performance problem</h1>
                <pre>
Hello,

My existing program runs 20-60 times slower in LispWorks than in the other CL implementations that I've been using - using different tests, I got a performance difference to other CLs by order of magnitude.  Benchmarking with somebody else's benchmark, I see the same thing (see below). 

This is the Personal edition, on an i7 Mac, nothing special.
I use "compile and load" to compile the source files in question.  I have tried to (declaim (optimize (speed 3) (space 0) (debug 0))), which made a difference, but not much.

What am I doing wrong?  This is not at all in line with what I've read about LispWorks.  
I'm new to LispWorks, so chances are I'm missing an essential step or setting.  Apologies.  I checked the FAQ and KB.

Thanks for your help.

- David

The "calls to eval" line is suspect.

I get the following results (on LW6 Professional) after compiling the 
forms comprising that particular benchmark:

CL-BENCH.GABRIEL 2 &gt (extended-time (run-triangle))
Timing the evaluation of (PROGN (RUN-TRIANGLE))

User time    =        0.166
System time  =        0.004
Elapsed time =        0.171
Allocation   = 152288 bytes
1 Page faults

As you are no doubt aware, one of the limitations of LW Personal is the 
lack of COMPILE-FILE.  What happens when you select the forms for this 
particular benchmark and do Control-Shift-r (or M-x Compile Region, or 
M-x Compile Buffer)?

I used the original triangle test. The test code for triangle stuff is the same as in 'improved' tests.

Here are my results (LW6 Prof, Win32):

CL-USER 40 &gt (time-triangle)

User time    =        0.202
System time  =        0.000

User time    =       31.215
System time  =        0.202
Elapsed time =       31.068

0 Page faults

The first run is for compiled code, the last one is for interpreted code.


&gt What am I doing wrong?

Nothing I guess. You just compare compiled sbcl code with interpreted code in LW. :-)

 Art

I did some profiling on a bit of seemingly slow CAPI drawing code not that  
long ago and found out that 67% of the work were calls to EVAL even though  
the drawing functions were perfectly compiled.

Naturally, the code did not contain any calls to EVAL explicitly.

Hard to believe to me. If there is at least a bit of interpreted code in the code being profiled, you'll see eval, a lot of them especially if the interpreted code is "topmost" forms/functions to the "innermost" compiled forms/functions.

&gt Naturally, the code did not contain any calls to EVAL
&gt explicitly.

Consider this code:

(defun foo (n)
  (dotimes (i n)
    (1+ i)))

Then profile two times (foo 1000000). The first time, foo being a compiled function, the second time foo beging an interpreted function. In the last profile run you'll spot a lot of eval on the stack when profiling, even though there is no explicit calls to eval in foo (if that is what you meant by "calls to eval").

Best,
 Art

Hm, try this:

(defun draw-grid (pane cols rows)
   (gp:clear-graphics-port pane)
   (loop for x from 0 to 100 by (/ 100 cols)
         do (gp:draw-line pane x 0 x 100 :dashed t))
   (loop for y from 0 to 100 by (/ 100 rows)
         do (gp:draw-line pane 0 y 100 y :dashed t)))

(gp:set-graphics-port-coordinates (setf pane (capi:contain (make-instance  
'capi:output-pane))) :left -5 :top 105 :bottom -5 :right 105)

(defun test nil
   (loop repeat 500 do (draw-grid pane 50 50)))

Again, I had all this code compiled.

OK, I'll do that.
