                <h1>externalize-image</h1>
                <pre>
I'm trying to use externalize-image to move an image between windows.
I have the following test:

(defun externalize-test (file)
  (let* ((b (capi:contain (make-instance 'capi:pinboard-layout)))
         (orig (gp:load-image b file :editable :with-alpha)))
    (capi:manipulate-pinboard
     b
     (make-instance 'capi:image-pinboard-object
         :image orig :x 10 :y 10)
     :add-top)
    (let* ((ext (gp:externalize-image b orig))
           (copy (gp:load-image b ext :editable :with-alpha)))
      (capi:manipulate-pinboard
       b
       (make-instance 'capi:image-pinboard-object
           :image copy :x 100 :y (gp:image-height orig))
       :add-top))))


If I call this with a .jpg file, it works as expected, showing two
identical copies of the image from the file.  But if I call it with a
..png file, the second copy gets a black background.  What am I doing
wrong?

I get funky drawing (i.e., a blank background - did you mean "black" or "blank?") even with a jpeg unless I call gp:invalidate-rectangle on the pinboard-layout (i.e., b) after the second call to capi:manipulate-pinboard, though this may not be the underlying issue.

I meant black, at least that's what happens with the images I have.

It seems to have something to do with transparency.  If I set the
pinboard background to green so I can see which bits in the original
image are transparent and which are just white, I notice that the
round trip through externalize-image turns the transparent bits to
black.  In my jpg images  the background was plain white, and that
worked fine through the round trip.

So maybe externalize-image doesn't preserve the alpha values?  Is
there any way to make it do so?

Yes, that's the problem.  Externalize-image always generates a bmp file, but
there is no standard definition for bmp files with transparency.

Can you use the image access APIs (in particular,
gp:image-access-pixels-from-bgra, gp:image-access-pixels-to-bgra and
gp:make-image) instead of externalize-image?

Does "around_small.png" actually have an alpha channel? Does (gp:load-image b "around_small.png" :editable t) work?

Didn't realize you'd attached it. It appears not to have an alpha cannel. I don't think :editable :with-alpha will work unless the image already has an alpha channel.

Just add an alpha channel with an image editor (I did it with GraphicConverter - Picture:Alpha Channel:Add Alpha Channel) and then it works.

How can I know whether it has an alpha channel or not before I open
it?  I do want the alpha channel if the image has one.  I am going to
be opening arbitrary image files selected by the user.
