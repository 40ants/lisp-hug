                <h1>Starter-pack and documentation search</h1>
                <pre>Hi there,

just coming back to lisping after a couple years break and have Lispworks
5.0.2 Pro running with the latest starter-pack installed. All seemed good
until today when trying to do an F5 documentation search the IDE came up
with a debug window shown in the attachment. I remember it working
properly back then and the funny bit is that the search seems to work fine
when the search pertains to the CL hyperspecs docs but an error happens
when searching within the lispworks specific documentation.

For example, a search with a FORMAT string will come up with the
appropriate page while a search for something like OUTPUT-PANE will result
in an error described. There is a bit too much of low level stuff going on
in the debugger to make any sense out of from where I am standing,
maybe someone has came across this before?

I tried that and it did not help, the dialog pops up again no matter what  
option is chosen.
The thing is that it throws in errors only when a non hyperspec entry is  
searched for, otherwise it opens up the default browser nicely.

This looks like a bug in LW-ADD-ONS (or LW-DOC), so you should ask Edi
Weitz. Only, MOP and LispWorks specific documentation seems to be
affected. In LispWorks 6.0.1 Pro for Linux I don't get an error, but I
do get an invalid URL in my browser. E.g. for capi:output-pane: 
file://usr/local/lib/LispWorks/lib/6-0-0-0/manual/online/web//usr/local/lib/LispWorks/lib/6-0-0-0/manual/online/web/CAPRM/html/capiref-262.htm#marker-4173290

LispWorks 6.0.1 Pro for Windows does signal an error:

Error: Bad result from ShellExecute 2
  1 (continue) Abort editor command.
  2 (abort) Return to event loop.
  3 Destroy interface "Listener 1" (of type LISPWORKS-TOOLS:LISTENER)

CL-USER 1 : 1 &gt :b

In the meantime, you can use LispWorks' own documentation look-up
facility (which works somewhat different) by pressing Ctrl-Shift-d when
the cursor is on a symbol. If you don't like the prompt, set
editor:*prompt-for-symbol-confirm* to nil:
(setq editor:*prompt-for-symbol-confirm* nil)

Regards.

Yep, the traceback looks exactly the same, did not bother to find out what  
all that means.

That seems to work just fine, thanks for the hint, that should do.

I've uploaded a new version of LW-DOC which hopefully fixes this
problem.  Thanks for the report.
