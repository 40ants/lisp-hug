&gt Any takers for a deeper discussion?

One taker for a more shallow discussion :^)

My years of experience with Apple have taught me a golden rule:

Dont fight the platform vendor.

The reason I explored the GCD route from LispWorks is to avoid being widowed/left behind should Apple move in this direction in a big way. There are arguably things the OS can do that individual apps/processes cannot do wrt scheduling, load balancing, etc. Even if there weren't, the OS can make sure that clients that use the published interfaces get preferential treatment. This is precisely what I saw in my gcd-pmap tests - my work effectively got scheduled twice - once for the drawing that LispWorks Capi was doing (via Cocoa/Quartz of course), and once for work pushed onto a GCD concurrent dispatch queue. As a result, on a dual core machine, I saw, at times, a more than 3x speedup relative to single threaded execution.

To break this down:

single threaded: my work and capi sharing time on the main thread - result, only one core used at a time

lispworks mp: capi on the the main thread, my work on multiple lw processes - result, uses both cores.

GCD: capi on the main thread, my work on a GCD concurrent queue - result, uses both cores AND, gets an extra scheduler slice because Apple treats GCD queues other than the app's main queue (a.k.a., its main thread) as a separate process for scheduling purposes.

The lesson for me from this example, and lots of other past experience, is clear. When the platform vendor says "do it this way," you are taking a really big risk if you choose to do it some other way. I think we need look no further than the recent flap over the iPhoneOS 4.0 developer agreement to see this.

 &gt Some really good points here! But elsewhere in the world, the other

 &gt strives to be platform neutral to a large degree.
 &gt 
 &gt I would love to see LW become Apple centric with respect to GCD. But
 &gt that leaves Windows and Linux in the dust, along with all of us
 &gt writing programs for any but Apple hardware.
 &gt 
 &gt 

I don't think GCD is all that innovative- for example Solaris's C/C++
compiler has been able to dispatch work units (unrolled loops, blocks of
code with suitable dependencies, etc) for quite a while, it is aware of
the # of processors and acts accordingly.  Performance improvements vary
of course, and when the automatic parallelization is used, are sometimes
negligable.  OTOH I did experience significant improvements in gzip/bzip
performance when compiling w/ Sun's compiler- OTOH I can't fully
attribute that to parallelization since plain old optimization applies
as well.

I attended IIRC a NUMA system sales pitch some years ago which employed a
preprocessor to pick off programmer-supplied primitives that selected
storage classes and processing options.

Which isn't to say GCD is bad or not worth doing, but I wonder how well
the approach will scale.  Sun dealt at length with scalability to many
processors on their fancy cluster machines and quickly found techniques
which scaled to 4 cpu's don't necessarily scale to 16, for example.

 &gt 
 &gt Well that is very interesting... because we are looking in the near
 &gt term at computers offering upwards of 70 cores.
 &gt 
 &gt So are you also suggesting that using threads scales better? Perhaps
 &gt one or the other of GCD or Threads is simply going to be the best of
 &gt not very commendable approaches?

IIRC the problem wasn't threads vs processes but serialization due to
the lockfree api's used to support the applications- essentially the
lockfree algorithms while permitting scaling better than conventional OS
resource locking caused enough cache and mmu pressure that scaling was
still limited.  Bonwick's slab allocator paper has always seemed to me
to be a great investigation into parallelization and its associated
gotchas, from application layer down to cache and MMU issues.

What GCD seems to offer are application layer semantics that a program
can use to distribute bits of code to some number of processing units-
threads vs processes don't seem pertinent- though context switch time is
certainly a factor.

My interest is more in how well such an approach scales when there
are lots of work units and lots of processors; specifically, will GCD
become a bottleneck?  Once work units are out on a cpu in whatever form
the tasking takes, the bottleneck cost has already been incurred.


 &gt And my whole point for bringing up this discussion wasn't so much to
 &gt criticize threads or suggest superiority of GCD, but rather to point
 &gt out that at a more fundamental level, these two approaches are
 &gt implementation issues for offering system-wide services, and that of
 &gt more direct interest to the programmer (user) would be a uniform,
 &gt simple, protocol based on these magical "channels". How the channels
 &gt are implemented is of no concern to the service user. And the same
 &gt services could be offered through any number of different
 &gt implementations. Runtime introspection could help the implementation
 &gt choose one form over another. GCD, for example, will be of no use on
 &gt Windows.

I disagree- Windows certainly supports threads- GCD work units are not
some new form of task.  GCD seems admirably suited to be a library and
api that an application uses when it has runtime knowledge of how
application-layer work units can be distributed.  I think it would work
fine on pretty much any multitasking OS- though of most use when its
also multiprocessing.  Its value seems to be in how easily and
efficiently the programmer is able to express &amp; control the desired
parallelization.  For instance at high levels of parallelization, will
GCD support policy features which allow the programmer to control the
ratios (if not quantities) of different work units according to some
application-specific algorithm?  Will GCD tune its dispatch algorithm to
attempt to find and/or maintain at least a local throughput maxima?

The dynamics of a few dozen work units over a couple processors vs
hundreds or thousands over 50 processors are very different.

&gt Work queues appear to avoid the problem of indefinite starvation of writers, since the lock request channel could be a FIFO serialized work queue. But readers, once reaching the head of the queue need to be asynchronously dispatched concurrently, while writers need to be dispatched synchronously, but only after all current readers have completed. Additional readers and writers would naturally be held off while any writer is working, due to the synchronous dispatch. But time-limit interrupts always need to be pushed to the head of the queue and not held off until a FIFO ordering would dictate.
&gt 
&gt So this problem isn't quite so easy to map onto GCD because of the mix of dispatch behaviors between readers and writers.

GCD tasks can have dependencies (e.g., one task can be set not to run until another has completed). GCD queues can have differing priorities. Seems like these two things might be used to get the behavior you want.

BTW, I believe libdispatch has been ported to linux, so of the major platforms LispWorks supports, it's only Windows which doesn't have it.

I've heard that dispatch queues are added in iPhone OS 4.0, and are the means by which user application multi-tasking is implemented (Apple's iPhone apps have had multi-tasking all along).

&gt I do have a question in my mind, that I'm about to explore... Thus far, Okeanos (a database) has considered thread ID as the overall transaction identity, for tracking who has locks, who's lease should be retracted, and so on. Now when you move to GCD protocols, what happens to thread identity in Lisp? I half expect that I need to stop using thread ID as a primary identification. But then, who should be interrupted when a lease expires?

a. If you use GCD from c/objective-c you're not supposed to use locks at all, just serial queues. I use locks in LW because the overhead of pushing a lisp function call onto a serial queue is way higher than taking a lispworks mp:lock.

b. Don't GCD tasks have identity (e.g., isn't this how you query their results)?

Sorry for the short reply - I'm on my way out the door.

This is what task queues do. Tasks don't return. Anything that's interested in their result must actively query it (or, if you want to, block waiting for it).

A couple times you seem to have made a distinction between threads and
something that is a GCD work unit, also presumably scheduled by the OS-
could you be more specific as to how they differ?  Obviously they are
instantiated by two different API's, but I'm more wondering in what way
they are different with respect to the OS.  

It seems to me that GCD in a process is always going to be implemented
via threads- essentially, using whatever scheduling features the host OS
provides to userspace which permit sharing of the process's address
space, which pretty much always means threads of whatever flavor.  If
GCD work units do not execute via a thread, how do they execute?  I
agree the application doesn't care in general however.

If the distinction is that a thread "normally" runs within a designated
and limited heirarchy of calls in the app's code space wheras GCD work
units are short bits of code an otherwise idle thread calls indirectly,
which after completing, goes back to idle; then they don't appear much
different to me- its all simple userspace threaded code differing only
in its runtime architecture.

I'm not sure what "cross-network" means here- is there a reason a GCD
"dispatched" bit of code can't do socket I/O?

Yes, GCD/libdispatch tasks execute via OS thread pools. Apart from the OS optimizing thread creation and task scheduling for you, another speed advantage compared to typical thread pool implementations in user code is that the queues themselves are lockless - they use the functions in OSAtomic.h.

 &gt I am not in any position to give a definitive answer here. Apple

 &gt surely the GCD work queues dispatch into a pool of specialized worker

 &gt -- the difference is how to get to them.

A thread is pretty much the lightest "unit of scheduling", in userspace
at least.  "faster than typical threads" sounds like marketing-speak for
keeping threads in a pool and waking them up for work rather than
creating/destroying.


 &gt 
 &gt By cross-network, or cross-process, I mean communication of a service
 &gt request from one VM address space to another. It doesn't matter
 &gt whether on the same machine or not. Functions cannot be portably
 &gt marshalled across VM boundaries. And so you cannot push a closure
 &gt into a worker queue in some other VM address space.

RPC does that sort of thing all the time, unless I misunderstand you.
If a closure could be arranged as a block of data then it might marshall
over RPC.  Sounds kind of science-fictiony though.



 &gt Normal data can always be copied, in some manner, between address
 &gt spaces. But threads, open file streams, socket streams, and
 &gt functional closures cannot be copied in any sensible manner between
 &gt different address spaces and arbitrarily different machine
 &gt architectures. There may be other kinds of data that cannot be
 &gt copied. But most conventional data -- structs, classes, class
 &gt instances, scalar values, arrays -- can all be marshalled safely.
 &gt 
 &gt Sure, there is "process migration" between like-architecture machines
 &gt and like-operating systems. But that is very specialized compared to,
 &gt say, a wide area network with any number of different machines,
 &gt architectures, and OS's.

NFS does this kind of thing all the time with simple parms.  But doing
it with a closure does seem more complicated though.

Sorry - I was clearly too telegraphic in my abbreviated message to which you're replying.

I meant, each instance of NSOperation (really, of its subclasses NSInvocationOperation and NSBlockOperation) has identity in the sense that lisp objects have identity and can be compared with eq. Instances of NSInvocationOperation have identity - they're compared with isEqual:. isEqual is in turn implemented by "hash" so you could treat the hash value of the NSOperation instance as the work unit "ID number" if you wish.

So the concurrent task is the unit of execution, not the OS thread it happens to be running on. This is the level of granularity you should be interested in in terms of who holds what resources, etc, not threads.

The exception to this is serial queues. When you use serial queues as a substitute for locks/monitors, then it is the queue as a whole which can be said to "hold" a particular resource, with the task currently executing on that serial queue holding that resource instantaneously (i.e., "right now").

So in summary, and in answer to your original question:

 "Now when you move to GCD protocols, what happens to thread identity in Lisp? I half expect that I need to stop using thread ID as a primary identification."

Yes, you should probably stop using thread ID as a primary identification. If you're using GCD (especially via cocoa's NSOperation subclasses), you should consider the individual NSOperation instance in the case of concurrent operations, or the individual NSOperationQueue in the case of serial queues used as locks, as the primary identity, and the hash values of these instances as their "ID number."

&gt You can never know in a GCD world just what thread or task or queue your working is running in.

Well you can't know the thread, but you can know the queue - the task is guaranteed to run in the queue to which you assign it. What you don't know is how many OS threads that queue (which is essentially a dynamically resized thread pool) runs its tasks on.

&gt Still.... this causes a dilemma with respect to leased read / write locks on a database. Some thread has to be told to enter an error condition if a lock lease expires.

I would suggest that this is a job for the queue, not the individual task, and certainly not for any thread (which may come and go at the queue's choosing). I think a subclass of NSOperationQueue could take care of dealing with lock lease expiration (for example, by canceling all operations on that queue). Then each task would just periodically check (@ self "isCancelled") and exit if so (this is the prescribed pattern in the Apple docs btw). The NSOperationQueue subclass would be responsible for any commits because it would know whether it still held the lock.

&gt Ughhh... polling... But for now you may be right. OTOH, if I'm polling, I can check the state of a lexical variable, and thereby avoid killing possibly unrelated tasks in the same queue.

If you don't like polling you could simply let all tasks run to completion without polling and only use the results known to be valid. With your example, upon completion, each task could enqueue its result on a serial commit queue and any result that arrives after the expiry of the lock lease would be ignored.

&gt Okay, after bending your ears for these past several days, it is only fair to provide some  code.

Thanks for this - interesting idea to abstract away the details of how a requested service is implemented.
