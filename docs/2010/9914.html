Yes, but note that the chapter you mention (3) serves only as an
introductory example, without going into the details. The second
paragraph of chapter 3 states: 
"In this chapter, I'll cover just enough Lisp as we go along for you to
understand how the code works. But I'll gloss over quite a few
details. For now you needn't sweat the small stuff--the next several
chapters will cover all the Common Lisp constructs used here, and more,
in a much more systematic way." 

So, I won't worry too much if things seems a bit fuzzy after reading
chapter 3 only.
