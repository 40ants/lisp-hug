                <h1>Slider Pane</h1>
                <pre>
I'm having problems with the CAPI:SLIDER pane on LWM 6.0.1 (Mac OS X v. 10.6.5, MacBook Pro).

First of all, the documentation seems to be lacking. I don't see where SLIDER or any of its superclasses explains the arguments required by its CALLBACK. I've figured those out, I think: item, value and action.

I see from a 2008 email that SHOW-VALUE-P is ignored on Cocoa. It apparently still does nothing on Cocoa.

I'm trying to use it to set the system sound volume, and I'd like to play a sound sample whenever the slider is used to change the volume. Responding to :MOVE actions seems to be the right thing to do (as opposed to :DRAG). But for some reason, the slider callback is called twice with a :MOVE action every time the slug is moved.

Here's some code to illustrate:


(defun say (what)
  (system:call-system
   (format nil "osascript -e 'say ~C~A~C'" #\" what #\")))

(defun set-loudness (n)
  "Set system sound volume to a number between 0 and 7."
  (system:call-system
   (format nil "osascript -e 'set volume ~D'" n)))


(defun loudness-callback (item value action)
  (when (equal action :move)
      (set-loudness value)
      (say "Loud enough?")))

(capi:contain (make-instance 'capi:slider
             :orientation :vertical
             :start-point :bottom
             :start 0
             :end 7
             :slug-start 5
             :show-value-p t ; no effect on Cocoa
             :callback 'loudness-callback
             :title "Sound Volume"))


P.S. For extra points, does anyone know how I can get the original system sound volume so I can restore it? And how about getting a list of voices available?

             voice-identifier)))
      (objc:invoke the-synth "startSpeakingString:" a-string))))

(defun speak-all-voices ()
  (loop for voice-name in *available-voice-list* do
    (speak-string voice-name :voice voice-name)
      (sleep 2)))

You almost certainly shouldn't be doing this - they system wide volume is a user preference and applications should not be modifying it. You should be setting the volume (using setVolume:) of the individual NSSound or the NSSpeechSynthesizer that you're playing/using in your app.
