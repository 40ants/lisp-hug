                <h1>How to go about creating a node network</h1>Hi everyone,<div><br></div><div>I&#39;m quite new to LW and specially to CAPI, i wanted to know if any of you guys have any code samples or tutorials/references about how i could develop something like a node network. From what i&#39;ve read on CAPI Reference Guide and CAPI User Guide i believe i must use PINBOARD-LAYOUT and PINBOARD-OBJECT but sincerely all my struggle so far has not been all that successfull.</div>
<div><br></div><div>Thanks in advance for any help / hints,</div><div><br></div><div>Alexandre Paes</div>

Hi there.

I think you may find what you are looking folder in the examples directory:

....\LispWorks\lib\6-0-0-0\examples\capi\graphics

One in particular being, "circled-graph-nodes.lisp"

                 <h1>Re: How to go about creating a node network</h1>Hi guys,<div><br></div><div>Please consider this as an answer to everyone who politely shared ideas/tips/code with me so far, all you guys have been aswesome and have kindly shared invaluable knowledge.</div><div><br></div>
<div>I&#39;m taking another look into all the Lispworks examples mentioned and am also trying to follow along with SANLab, i don&#39;t think this is hard actually, i believe it&#39;s a bit of a paradigm shift from other guis i&#39;ve used (mostly C++) though and it&#39;s taking a bit of a hard time adapting to the huge potential of CAPI.</div>
<div><br></div><div>So thank you for sharing your hard earned knowledge on this matter with me. I will keep this updated as i progress on this quest.</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you so much once again,</div><div><br></div>
