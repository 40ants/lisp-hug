Below is a message I posted to lisp-hug from an unregistered email
account (so the message bounced). In spite of this, the helpful folks at
LispWorks still went through the trouble to open a ticket for my message
and answered my question. Here is the exchange in case someone else was
wondering about the same thing (especially helpful if you like black as
a background color while coding).

Hi

Does anyone know how to _independently_ set the window background color
of the in-place completion pop-up window in LispWorks 6.0 (Pro on
Debian)? E.g. when I put something like the following into my gtkrc
file, I can set the text color etc., but the background color style for
the pop-up window seems to be ignored when supplied.

style "non-focus-list-prompter-style" {
  text[NORMAL]      = "#90ee90"
}
widget "non-focus-list-prompter*" style "non-focus-list-prompter-style"

Also, what is the widget name for the 'Function Arglist Displayer'
window? I can only change the colors of the current argument via
Preferences|Environment|Styles|Style Name|Arglist Highlight. I would
like to change the rest of this window's appearance as well (or at least
the background color).

Thanks.
Nico

Hi Nico,

You asked about this on lisp-hug.

There is an undocumented variable capi::*editor-pane-in-place-background*
which defines the color for editor in-place completion windows.  If you set it
to nil, then the gtkrc value will be used.

The widget name of the 'Function Arglist Displayer' is ArglistDisplayer.  Its
background is controlled by the variable
capi-toolkit::*arglist-displayer-background*, in the same way.
