                <h1>How to convert in-memory DIB to image in LWW?</h1>
                <pre>
Hi,

I'm interfacing to a C application on Windows which returns a pointer
to an in-memory DIB (device-independent bitmap).  Is there a way to
use this pointer directly to create an (external) image usable in
CAPI/GP without storing the DIB to a file first and loading it from
there?

Thanks,
Edi.

That is a damn good question, strange no-one had asked this before.

&gt We're doing it by calling replace-foreign-array to copy the DIB's bytes into a Lisp array, then computing and prepending the DIB header, and then, finally, creating an external-image initialized with the resulting vector, and then using convert-external-image.

Mikel, thanks a lot, that did the trick for me.  (BTW, for someone
reading this later, Mikel meant "BMP header" above.)

The :data slot in external images contains the data as read from a BMP
file which means it contains the BMP header followed by the DIB data.
(BMP and DIB are the same except for this header.)

FWIW, here's the code I'm using now which worked for me in a few test
cases.  If it breaks, you can keep both parts:
