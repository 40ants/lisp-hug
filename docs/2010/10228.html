                <h1>squirrely drawing with gp:draw-polygon on Mac OS X</h1>
                <pre>
I'm getting weird results with draw-polygon. Here's a simple test case which should draw a close approximation of a circle. Instead, there are odd little bumps and divots at various points on the circle's circumference. Changing the defaut for :line-joint-style doesn't seem to rectify this. Load the following two functions, then execute:

(circle-window)

BTW, this code should be cross-platform compatible for all versions of LispWorks as it only uses capi and gp APIs.

(defun display-true-circle (self x y width height &amp;key divisions)
  (declare (ignore x y width height)
           (optimize (speed 0) (safety 3) (debug 3)))
  (let* ((vertex-list
          (loop with arc-increment = (/ (* 2 pi) divisions)
                for i below (* 2 pi) by arc-increment
                with center-x = 350
                with center-y = 350
                with radius = 200
                for perimeter-x = (+ center-x  (* radius (cos i)))
                for perimeter-y = (+ center-y  (* radius (sin i)))
                collect perimeter-x collect perimeter-y)))
    (gp:draw-polygon 
     self
     vertex-list
     :filled t 
     :foreground :orange)))



(defun circle-window (&amp;key (divisions 200))
  (capi:contain (make-instance
                 'capi:output-pane
                 :display-callback (lambda (self x y width height)
                                     (display-true-circle self x y width height
                                                          :divisions divisions))
                 :background :greenyellow)
                :best-width 700 :best-height 700))

Don't you think this is due to the fact that there is no anti-aliasing in
the draw functions of the CAPI ? Is you draw the circle not filled, you can
clearly see the approximation errors.

I tried also to make something with bezier curves using gp:draw-line, and
the result was very bad, for the same reason.

Best regards

Denis

There is anti-aliasing in draw-polygon on the mac, so, no I don't think that's what's going on here. (I think it's implemented using the underlying platform's polygon drawing primitives - on the mac, things like CGContextBeginPath, CGContextMoveToPoint, CGContextAddLineToPoint, CGContextClosePath, CGContextStrokePath, CGContextFillPath, and/or CGContextDrawPath, all of which take floats btw)

The drawing with gp:draw-polygon *is* antialised, it's just lumpy  - i.e., it's smooth, not pixel-jaggy-aliased, it's just that the smooth drawing has smooth lumps and smooth divots in it - it just isn't a circle.

Ralph

Ditto. The circle example was just an attempt to provide a minimal case whose intended output is unambiguous.

Clearly a number of us have tried (and failed) to use gp:draw-polygon to do cubic bezier curves (which it ought to be up to doing). Let's hope the LW guys can shed some light on this.

I sent it to support but haven't heard back yet (apart from the automated incident tracking number of course). I'll be sure to let the list know if I hear anything useful from support.
