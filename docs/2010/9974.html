                <h1>Default Edit menu in LW6</h1>
                <pre>
Hi all,

I have an application written with LW5 using capi and now moving to LW6. However, there is a random Edit menu that LW6 inserts into my menu bar that is not there in LW5, and it comes before any of the other menu items including the File menu. Is there any way to disable this new unwanted menu item?

Does the :auto-menus argument [1] to the interface change anything?  I
don't get the impression that the :no-character-palette window-style
should cause an edit menu to be create, but it might be something else
worth playing around with.

It's actually a little bit odd, I think, that

(capi:display (make-instance 'capi:interface))

has fewer menus (3: Lispworks, Edit, Window) than

(capi:display (make-instance 'capi:interface :auto-menus nil))

which has 4: LispWorks, File, Edit, and Window.  Of course, those
aren't any kind of specialized interfaces, so it's not really all that
important what happens there.  It's just bizarre in light of
"auto-menus  defaults to t , which means that an interface may have
some automatic menus created by the environment in which it is running
(for example the Works  menu in the Common LispWorks environment). To
switch these automatic menus off, pass :auto-menus  nil ."

(The URL shows this to be a 5.1 thing, but I don't remember doing
anything with auto-menus until this latest version.)
