After hitting the roadblock of load-all-patches and save-image being
unavailable, I finally noticed the note at the bottom: "Use of
LispWorks Personal Edition with SLIME is not supported."

I am curious because it seems inconsistent. The IDE is available for
evaluation, but not a command-line version?

My question is, Is it unavailable by design or circumstance? That is,
is it unavailable because the higher-ups said, "No, no, we don't want
it working with SLIME," or is it unavailable because SLIME requires a
command-line executable, which requires load-all-patches and
save-image, which are unavailable?

Any possibility of a command-line Personal Edition option?

Thanks, that worked.

Since this is slightly less than trivial, I'll recount my steps for posterity:

* Update to latest slime from CVS.

* Load this into the LispWorks IDE:

(load "/path/to/slime/swank-loader")
(swank-loader:init)
(swank:create-server :port 4005)

* Inside Emacs, M-x slime-connect. Use the port given above. Done!

LispWorks needs to update this documentation:

http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw51/LWUG/html/lwuser-16.htm

It's misleading to say "Use of LispWorks Personal Edition with SLIME
is not supported." It also doesn't mention running swank separately.
The combination of those two things suggests some sort of crippleware,
which is not the case.

And I'll suggest again that offering a command-line version of
Personal Edition would be by far the most convenient option for
first-time users who are SLIME devotees.

My first impression of LispWorks could have easily been much better.

Thanks,
GK
