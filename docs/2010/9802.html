                <h1>Changing choice selections &amp; triggering callbacks?</h1>
                <pre>
Hi all,  (something of a busy weekend, it seems)

Is there a way to programatically modify the selection of a
capi:choice such that the appropriate selection-, retract-, and
extend-callbacks get triggered?  I'm working on a UI that has a
selection and I can avoid some plumbing by including capi:choice as a
superclass if I can tie the input-model to selection modifying calls.
I tried (setf (capi:choice-selection ...) ...), but that doesn't
trigger the callbacks, as shown by the code below.  Implementing
choice-like behavior isn't all that hard, but I'd avoid reimplementing
if possible.  Thanks in advance,  //JT

(On LWM 6.0 Intel)

CL-USER 18 &gt (defun announce (&amp;rest args)
               (capi:display-message "~A" args))
ANNOUNCE

CL-USER 19 &gt (defparameter *choice*
               (make-instance 'capi:list-panel
                              :interaction :extended-selection
                              :retract-callback 'announce
                              :selection-callback 'announce
                              :extend-callback 'announce
                              :items '(one two three four)
                              :selection (list 0 1)))
*CHOICE*

CL-USER 20 &gt (capi:contain *choice*)
#&lt;CAPI:LIST-PANEL [4 items] 226E6337&gt

CL-USER 21 &gt (setf (capi:choice-selection *choice*) (list 0 2))
(0 2) ; and no messages displayed

What would help, IMO is if CAPI exposed a general CALL-CALLBACK method,
which would take a callbacks object, a callback-kind, and the data with
which to call the callback.

For Eg.: (CALL-CALLBACK OBJ :RETRACT-CALLBACK 'THREE)

would figure out that (capi:callbacks-callback-type obj) is :FULL (say),
and then it would evaluate
(funcall (capi:callbacks-retract-callback obj)
  'three obj (capi:element-interface-for-callback obj))
as appropriate.

If CALL-CALLBACK were available, you could easily write a mixin class
with an around method on (SETF:CAPI-CHOICE-SELECTION) which could figure
out the callback-kind (i.e. RETRACT-CALLBACK or whatever--- depending on
what changed) and the data, and then call CALL-CALLBACK explicitly in
your user code, rather than code up a CHOICE element from scratch.

I don't think this is available as it stands, and it would probably come
at the cost of complicating the CAPI model slightly: As I understand it,
callbacks are only executed by CAPI in reaction to GUI events, and never
by the user.

Indeed.  [The OP's requirement actually belied an "Inversion of MVC" ---
It would have been straightforward for his callbacks to call user
functions XYZ , and to call the same functions XYZ from inside the
(:around / SETF) methods, which would make changes to model
programatically.]

W.R.T. your point 1, the very reason for requesting CAPI to provide this
method is that there is such a variety of callback types; The only place
where I use it is where I'm writing an Interface and want to support the
full callbacks API of CAPI for my Interface users, (and making sure the
user callbacks get called in the right thread.)  So it is more of a
concern of having the code in one place, and making it work as LW
specifies.

Thanks for the replies from Madhu and Dmitriy Ivanov!

My need to have something working overrode my urge to use presumed
existing CAPI functionality to make it happen.  My particular
situation at hand has a (subclass of) capi:pinboard-layout with
various capi:pinboard-objects in it.  I added a selection slot to the
layout, and defined my own methods workspace-extend-callback and
workspace-retract-callback that I call from selection modifying code.
(E.g., shift-clicking (on OS X) an unselected object calls
workspace-extend-selection which includes a call to workspace-extend
callback.)  It's neither much code nor inconvenience;  it just seemed
as though I was reimplementing something that must already be under
the hood.

Thanks again,  //JT
