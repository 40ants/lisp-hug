It doesn't help diagnose your problem, but I'm on LWM6, and I can
scroll non-focused (and focused) editor panes using two fingers on a
trackpad as well as with the ball/wheel in an Apple mouse.  I don't
recall changing any preferences to get this, and I don't see any
relevant preferences in LW or in OS X.  Any other details about your
system setup?  //JT

Same here - I can scroll with trackpad and scroll-wheel in non focused panes and windows and even in non-focused panes and windows when LW is in the background (i.e., from other applications). LWM 6.0, 64-bit Intel, Mac OS X 10.6.2.
