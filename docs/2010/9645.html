                <h1>(Lisp-HUG) Push Button Background Color...</h1>
                <pre>
Hello to the List from the snowy Rocky Mountains...

I am cleaning-up/sparkling-up some production code and am trying to 
get push buttons to change their background colors...     ...and 
realize, after some experimenting, that I don't know how to do that.

Specifying :foreground/:background in the (make-instance 
'capi:push-button... ) call sets the foreground/background allright, 
but those appear to be the colors of the outlining borders - and not 
the color of the actual plane background of the button.

I am trying to convince a push button to flash a different color 
(i.e., the actual background of the button - not just the border) when pressed.

All that I am able to get is the usual blah-grey color of CAPI buttons.

Any pointers on how to do that???  I appreciate it.

The following works for me (5.1/Motif; the documentation states that 
:press-callback is not supported on Cocoa):

(defun foo (&amp;key (default :grey80)
                  (clicked :red)
                  (cb (constantly nil)))
   (let ((colors (list default clicked)))
     (flet ((change-color (b)
              (rotatef (first colors)
                       (second colors))
              (setf (capi:simple-pane-background b)
                    (first colors))))
       (make-instance 'capi:push-button
                      :text "Click Me"
                      :callback-type :item
                      :press-callback #'change-color
                      :selection-callback
                      (lambda (b)
                        (change-color b)
                        (funcall cb b))))))

Yes, I see what you are doing with the (setf (capi:simple-pane-background
....))<br><br>
However, on my Windows XP system, I still just get a blah-grey background
with, now, a colored border...<br><br>
I think the issue distills down to why do I not see a :red pane color
that surrounds the &quot;Click Me&quot; (also not :green) text in the
following:&nbsp;&nbsp; (hopefully, the list server will allow the small
embedded image to come across):<br><br>
<img src="cid:7.1.0.9.2.20100106154549.039bd550@frobenius.com.0" width=506 height=148 alt="Emacs!">
<br><br>
e.g., is there some rational way to have :green text and a :red
background pane inside a CAPI button?<br><br>

Thank You Evan for that piece of information --

I appreciate it.

Amazing to me that MicroSoft would leave out such a fundamental thing.

I have been wandering aimlessly through documentation and code 
snippets trying to figure out just what silly thing I have been doing wrong.

I suppose that an option would be to implement my own 
Colorable-Push-Button class that actually does what I need and try to 
integrate that into CAPI - but, Good Heavens, what a 
pain...   ...would probably take a few days of fumbling about 
deciphering CAPI classes/slots etc to get such a thing correct.

Sorry for the delay in responding to people that commented on my 
question "Push Button Background Color".

I had abdominal surgery this past Friday which really knocked me down 
a bit.  The Good News is that the Docs used a laproscopic technique 
that minimized the chopping and hacking.  But, I still feel like I 
was shot in the gut :(         Hooray for the narcotic/pain-killer 
"Vicodin" :)))

Dmitriy - You are clearly correct in your statement. However, I use 
Lisp to build embedded soft-realtime systems where I don't want the 
system to look like MicroSoft Windows at all - more like an iPhone in 
this case. My application is controlled with a built-in touchscreen 
and so I need active things other than Windows-styled buttons (I use 
"Windows XP Embedded" booting out of flash memory rather than 
straight "Windows XP").

Please see http://www.secureoutcomes.net/livescan-products.html for 
the embedded system - written completely in LW Common Lisp (along 
with CLOS, CAPI &amp; Friends).

"Laughing Water" suggested (Thank You!) that I use :image buttons to 
do what I need to do - which is when a text "button" is pressed on 
the touchscreen, that the button-thing flash a different color (Blue) 
for, say, 100-milliseconds so the user knows that the button really activated.

I have tried that and it works well with one exception - I do not see 
the "flash" :image button unless I inject a (capi:display-message 
"XXX") while the flash button is active. I can replace the 
(capi:display-message) with a (sleep 5) and I *still* do not see the 
flash image button (the Sleep should allow the various processes 
associated with the other buttons etc to run - just as does the 
(capi:display-message) - but "something" is *very* different between the two).

I have defined two buttons - one is :text that normally shows. The 
:callback for the :text button (capi:hide-pane )'s itself and then 
(capi:show-pane)'s the "flash" button through its process which is 
the same size and has the exact same (X, Y) coordinates on the 
layout/interface. It then waits 100-milliseconds and then reverses 
the sequence to bring the :text button back up and to hide the 
"Flash" button...

I have taken the relevant code out of the production code and 
produced the following simple snippet:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(defun test-button()

   (let* ((solid-blue-button (make-instance 
'capi:push-button                                       ; Solid-Blue 
:Image Button for the "flash". It lives "under" the :text button.

                                            :x 50 :y 50

                                            :text nil
                                            :image "d:/ls1100 
runtime/bilder/solid-blue-image.bmp"  ; This is a 50x60 pixel blue .bmp file

                                            :external-min-width 50
                                            :external-max-width 50
                                            :external-min-height 60
                                            :external-max-height 60))

     (capi:display 
interface))) 
; Activate the button...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The interesting thing - and hangup - is that if you run the above 
code (you will need that 50x60 pixel blue .bmp file), you will see 
the blue "flash" when you press the button. But, if you comment out 
the (capi:display-message) and rely solely on the (sleep 0.100), you 
do NOT see the blue "flash".

Thoughts???

What am I doing wrong in my narcotic-induced haze??

I appreciate any feedback.

&gt with CLOS, CAPI &amp; Friends).

Can you make a brief summary and post it here on why you use CL in
your products, why a (the :) commercial version of CL and how you came
to CL in your company? I'm asking this because it is hard to find
real-world up-to-date examples of use of CL for commercial applications;
and because as I see it there is a notion among some lispers that current
free implementations of CL are somewhat "better" than commercial ones.

Best,
