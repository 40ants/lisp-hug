                <h1>Mac OS X system highlight color</h1>
                <pre>
This may be more of a Mac question than a LispWorks question, but here goes:

I've been looking for a way to get the Mac OS X system color for highlighting items in scrollable lists, such as in CAPI:LIST-PANEL.

What I'm actually trying to do is work around the limitations of LIST-PANEL (no colored text on Cocoa) and perhaps avail myself of even more drawing possibilities by using a GRID-LAYOUT containing OUTPUT-PANEs. For now, it would be great if I could use the operating system's highlight color for selected items.

To put this in context, I'm displaying a list of refrigeration temperature probes and want their colors to indicate their status. The selected probe has a graph showing its history, and I'd like the selection to be indicated in the standard way.

I am of course open to any brighter ideas out there; for example, if there's a way to get at the drawing function (not just plain printing of text) that I assume is buried somewhere in LIST-PANEL (or more likely, is buried in Apple's code, which would explain why Cocoa is the exception for colored text in LIST-PANEL).

Thanks, as always, for your help.

I recently discovered that :color_highlight is a valid color (i.e.
:background or :foreground) argument to drawing functions.
