                <h1>Autocomplete in LWW6</h1>
                <pre>
After installing LWW6, symbol completion does not work as well as it 
used to in 5.1. For example, "m-v-b" doesn't complete any more, but 
"multiple-value" still does (it pops up a dialog). It looks like it 
doesn't complete unless the beginning of the symbol is used. I am using 
lw-add-ons with TAB completion.

Is there a variable I need to set after the LW6 upgrade to get the old 
behavior?

The fact that "m-v-b" worked in previous versions was a feature of
LW-ADD-ONS and not of LispWorks.  I haven't found the time yet to
integrate this feature with LW6, but I seem to remember that I had
some problems with it and de-activated it.

You might want to play with this value:

  http://weitz.de/lw-add-ons/#*use-abbreviated-complete-symbol*

(I see the docstring says that the default is NIL, but I think it is T now.)

My apologies, but due to lack of time and because I mostly had to work
with other Lisp compilers recently, I haven't done any maintenance for
LW-ADD-ONS in the last months.

Edi.

I use LW6 32bit on Linux

I had a line in .lispworks that looked

(editor:bind-key "Indent And Complete Symbol" #\Tab)

changing it to the following line fixed the problem for me

(editor:bind-key "Indent And Complete Symbol" #\Tab :mode "Lisp")

  It looks like this is not a LW-ADD-ONS issue but a problem I am having 
binding TAB to "Indent and Complete Symbol". If I bind a different key 
to that command, it works fine. But if I do:

(editor:bind-key "Indent and Complete Symbol" #\Tab)

the binding of TAB isn't changed. It remains "Indent Selection or 
Complete Symbol".

  That worked. Thanks.
