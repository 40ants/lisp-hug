                <h1>multi-column list with checkboxes</h1>
                <pre>
Good afternoon all,

Be warned, CAPI noobie here!

Is it possible to have a listbox with two columns, one holding a text and the other a checkbox? Usage would be e.g., to replace a large set of checkboxes. From the CAPI guide/reference it seems you can only have lists with multiple text columns. But this is such a common UI pattern that I must be missing the right page in the manual, no?

And if that would be possible, would it be possible to change the checkbox's state *without* selecting the row?


Merci,
Peter.

I have the same question about having a column containing images.  I
would guess the underlying os widgets support this sort of thing, so
perhaps this is doable with some under the hood stuff with Cocoa/win32
or undocumented functions or whatever, but I don't know enough to
figure that out...
