                <h1>next-line-add-newlines?</h1>
                <pre>Does the LW editor have the equivalent of a statement like

  (setq next-line-add-newlines nil)

in GNU Emacs? I'm particularly interested in having such a feature in
an editor-pane belonging to a delivered application. It can be quite
annoying when pressing the down-arrow adds newlines behind your back
which change the semantics of what you've typed (in this particular
case).

Thanks,
Edi.

I'm really mystified now.  My editor (the actual LW editor not a pane
in an application) doesn't add newlines on C-n at the end of the
buffer, but I can't find anywhere that I set it!  Very mysterious.

I'm on Windows right now (LW 4.2.7 pro) and for me it adds exactly one
newline if I press down-arrow or C-n - in the editor itself as well as
in editor-panes. Only one but still too much for my task... :)

&gt
&gt You could use this variant of "Next Line" which warns instead of
&gt adding the newline, when on the last line in the buffer:
&gt 
&gt (editor:defcommand "Edi Next Line" (p)
&gt      "Moves the current point to the next line. Warns the 
&gt user when invoked on the last line. Ignores the prefix argument."
&gt      "Moves the current point down one line, except at the last line."
&gt   (declare (ignore  p))
&gt   (editor:next-line-command 1))

It works. Thanks!

Edi.

&gt Tim - is your buffer actually writable?

Yes.  I wonder what on earth I'm doing.

Oh.  Wait, I may have misunderstood.  If I type C-N in a *new* file it
will add a newline.  But only one.  It's not like the emacs behaviour
where by default it does (or used to, it's so long since I turned it
off I'm not sure if it still does).

My guess (without src...) is that this is something to do with the
should-a-newline-be-added-on-write thing?  If the file already ends in
a newline will it add an extra one?

Yes, I was, and it doesn't add one then.  Sorry for being confused!

Erm.  I meant `where by default it ... adds a newline each time you
say next-line at the end of the buffer'.  Sorry, I need a new brain.
