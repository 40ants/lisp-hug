Hi all,

I've seen something quite strange while programming. Perhaps I'm missins 
some part of the Lispworks documentation, but I really cannot understand 
what's happening. Here I go:

I've defined a parameter like this (defined when starting my application):

(defparameter *library-pool-instance* (make-instance 'library-container))

The class library-container has 5 instance variables which have always 
some non-empty lists (they contain objects of other classes) assigned to 
them. So, evertime I inspect the parameter *library-pool-instance* I can 
see those lists.

The problem is that after I come back from lunch (and it's not a joke) 
and I had left my application running (but doing nothing), all the 
instance variables of the *library-pool-instance* objects are set to 
nil! I thought then that perhaps the objects the *library-pool-instance* 
  had were garbage collected.  However I saw with the objects browser 
that all the instances (that were before pointed by the 
*library-pool-instance*) still existed.

Any idea of what's happening? I use Lispworks 4.1.20 for windows.

thanks.
Miro
