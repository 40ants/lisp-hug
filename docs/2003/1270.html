                <h1>FLI and Unix file descriptors</h1>
                <pre>Hi!

I'm looking for a way to get the underlying Unix file descriptor from
a LispWorks stream - something similar to what CMUCL has to offer:

  &lt;http://www.mail-archive.com/cmucl-help@cons.org/msg01034.html&gt

The closest thing I could find is IO:FILE-STREAM-FILE-HANDLE which is
exported from the IO package but doesn't seem to be documented. Is
this the way to go?

Thanks,
Edi.

&gt The internal accessor (if you must) is
&gt STREAM::OS-FILE-HANDLE-STREAM-FILE-HANDLE. Depending on what you do
&gt with the file descriptor, it could be dangerous as that CMUCL
&gt message you reference suggests, so I think the absence of an
&gt exported accessor in LispWorks is intentional.
&gt 
&gt What are you going to do with that fd? Anything that can't be
&gt achieved with Common Lisp?

As the subject line already suggested I'm working with the foreign
function interface - I don't think this could be easily done with CL
alone but I'll be happy if someone proves me wrong.

I'm trying to use parts of the GD library &lt;http://www.boutell.com/gd/&gt
to generate PNG images. I use UFFI for the FFI stuff (I want a program
which runs at least on LW and CMUCL) and I have a working version for
the tutorial example given at

  &lt;http://www.boutell.com/gd/manual2.0.15.html#basics&gt.

It looks like this:

  (defun foo ()
    (with-foreign-object (im 'gd-image)
      (setq im (gd-image-create 64 64))
      (let* ((black (gd-image-color-allocate im 0 0 0))
             (white (gd-image-color-allocate im 255 255 255)))
        (gd-image-line im 0 0 63 63 white)
        (with-open-file (s "/tmp/result.png" :direction :output :if-exists :supersede)
          (gd-image-png-fd im (system:fd-stream-fd s)))
        (gd-image-destroy im))))

This is for CMUCL but I was hoping to make it work with LW also.

Ah, by the way, all "gd-" function are direct calls to the
corresponding GD functions except for GD-IMAGE-PNG-FD which is my own
function. It looks like this:

  void gdImagePngFD(gdImagePtr im, int fd) {
    int fd2;
    FILE *f;

    fd2 = dup(fd);
    f = fdopen(fd2, "w");
    gdImagePng(im, f);
    fclose(f);
  }

I thought it might have been a good idea to "dup" the file descriptor
before I use it but maybe that's just na√Øve. The manpage isn't clear
about this (or I've missed it).

Of course, if I only wanted to work on files I could stop worrying
about Lisp streams and associated file handles and implement the whole
thing directly in C (accepting a C string for the file's
namestring). But eventually I want to able to write the images
directly to a socket stream (from my mod_lisp web server). That's why
I'm asking.

Is there a better, safer, Lisp-ier way to do it?

Thanks,
Edi.

I take it that you're not really asking me but Xanalys. Of course it
would be too difficult for me... :)

I've scanned the OSI docs from Franz and while I wish we had something
like this in LW I don't think it would help in this particular case
(interfacing with a foreign library which wants a file descriptor). In
particular:

  "There are a good number of system calls and library routines that
   take file descriptors, returned by the open() system call. In an
   effort to make this interface as natural in Lisp as possible, the
   corresponding functions in this module take a stream instead of a
   file descriptor. This means in general common-lisp:open should
   still be used to open files. However, you may want to open a file
   with open(2) flags for which there is no corresponding feature in
   Allegro CL (for example, the flag O_EXCL). For this purpose, the
   function os-open is provided. It also returns a stream instead of a
   file descriptor."

Cheers,
Edi.

Yes, this is what I meant with "if I only wanted to work on files" but
it wouldn't solve my real problem: I want to avoid writing the image
to a file but send it directly down the socket.

&gt 
&gt And would you then be wanting to write other stuff to your Lisp
&gt socket stream? How?

Well, it's a web server, so I want to send headers and afterwards send
the image data. Below is some example code which shows that this
actually works for CMUCL as well as for LW. If I compile and load this
code together with my GD UFFI definitions I can point my browser to
"http://localhost/lisp/foo.png" and see the PNG file I wanted to
see. See function SEND-OUTPUT at the end. The rest is standard
mod_lisp stuff.

I had to use COMM:SOCKET-STREAM-SOCKET in this case, though.

OK, now that it works what I want is your blessing. Tell me this
approach won't break my LW image and there won't be any demons flying
out of my nose... :)

Thanks,
Edi.

Yes, and the GD API actually includes functions to return this

&gt and writing/copying it to the stream? I do not know the UFFI, but
&gt something like:
&gt 
&gt (defun foo ()
&gt   (with-foreign-object (im 'gd-image)
&gt     (setq im (gd-image-create 64 64))

&gt             (gd-get-image-byte-array im)
&gt           (copy-foreign-array-to-stream s pointer :size byte-size :element-type
&gt 'unsigned-byte)))
&gt       (gd-image-destroy im))))
&gt 
&gt Basically copy-foreign-array-to-stream would use the UFFI to
&gt dereference the image bytes and write-byte each of them to the
&gt file/http stream.

I'll try this. I'm pretty sure this can be done with the LW FLI but I
don't think UFFI offers a portable way to do that - have to check.

The only problem I see is that WRITE-BYTE (why not WRITE-SEQUENCE, by
the way?) requires a binary stream, so I either have to change the
code for sending the headers so that it also works with binary socket
streams or I have to change the stream's element type on-the-fly which
seems to be possible with LW 4.3.

Thanks,
Edi.

Thanks, that's very kind of you.

FWIW, below is what I came up with in the meantime. The second version
of PNG-TO-STREAM needs some patches to UFFI which I just sent to Kevin
Rosenberg.

The CMUCL solution is currently sub-optimal. It'd certainly be better
to do the CAST (which conses) only once and take it out of the
loop. However, UFFI currently doesn't seem to have an idiom for this.

BTW, both solutions (yours and mine) will obviously fail on character
streams with the wrong external format.

  (with-open-file (s "/tmp/blob" :direction :output
                                 :external-format :utf-8
                                 :if-exists :supersede)
    (test-wfbb '(196) s))

This will create a file which is two octets long.

Thanks again for your help,
Edi.
