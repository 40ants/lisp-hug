                <h1>Can anyone help de-confuse me about CORBA</h1>
                <pre>I'm trying to extend my trivial command-line CORBA LW client program
such that the server can call back to clients to send them logging
information.  I'm doing this by defining a second interface, instances
of which get registered on the server, which then makes calls on
these objects to send them strings.  I've got spectacularly confused
while doing this, mostly because the `clients' actually need to be
servers from the point of view of this logging interface, and I can't
work out how to get that to work.

Does anyone understand CORBA, and particularly the CL bindings, well
enough to be able to help me with this?  I can describe the problem in
more detail (the above description is not enough, obviously), and
provide complete sources to what I'm trying to do (it's free, if
trivial, software though I haven't publicised it very widely yet...).

It might be better to do it by private mail, though if people would
rather see the gory details I don't mind.

Thanks

Doesn't HCL-ORB have an example of this? 

In any case there are plenty of examples on the net of simple CORBA
programs. You can just adapt one of these?

I'd be happy to inspect your code, but I don't have an installation to
debug it.

The trouble is that all the examples I can find have a fairly rigid
client-server distinction - the client calls the server, and those
calls return.  What I want is that the `client' registers itself with
the `server', which then spontaneously makes calls back to the
`client'.  I can't find examples of that, and the examples I can find
do hairy things with nameservices which I don't understand.

The problem is that, to make this work, someone has to tell the
initial application that something has changed.  So (using A and B
rather than client and server):

A: registers interest with B in getting log events.
A: waits on log queue for events, handles them when told
B: gets log event, needs to notify all registered As...

So the problem is that B needs to send some kind of notification to
all the A's who have registered with it, and I'm doing (or trying to)
that by having B make calls back into all the As In fact, I actually
just pass the string back with the call and avoid having the queue at
all.

The problem is that, I think, A and B need to agree about the world
they are in somehow, and I'm not sure how that happens.

Just set both programs up as proper servers. You say you can do one so
two must be trivial.

Then have the 'client' call the 'server' and pass an object reference
representing its own 'client' service. You say you have created a pure
client-server system so you must have had to create an object
reference and eg write the stringified form out into a file or
somewhere to pass to the client. Instead of stringifying it you need
to just pass it in a call. Should be even simpler. ( Of course, if you
have been relying on the client magically making up the reference to
the server because you know the port, hostname, and the fact that it
is the same ORB then this will be a new hurdle for you. )

Make the server record this object reference in a table of
'listeners'. Trivial non-CORBA issue.

When something happens on the 'server', it can invoke the callback
operation on the registered object references of the
'clients'. Trivial non-CORBA issue.

Each 'client' is subsequently called and can do what it likes. Trivial
non-CORBA issue.

So my wild guess is that you are having trouble with creating and/or
passing object references?

This is all a solved problem with CORBA. I still don't know what the
problem is.

CORBA isn't client-server except with respect to an individual
operation call. Callbacks are pretty simple to set up. There are later
issues you will encounter around things like persistence and liveness
and gc of dead references across a distributed system, but the basic
call-me-on-this-object-if-something-happens mechanism is fairly
trivial.

Well, no.  Or rather, maybe.  The server sits on a port at some level,
and it's not completely clear how to get it to sit on another port
(since they generally are on the same host) although this may be the
right thing to do.

I currently create an IOR, and stringify it in the initial server,
dumping it to a file.  the client then snarfs that IOR and talks in
the normal way.  I think I can pass object references around OK - at
least I've done this for other things, what I can't do is make it be
the case that the two servers (two ORBs, I guess) understand each
other.

The rest of what I'm trying to do is exactly what you describe - the
server maintains a list of listeners, and calls them back (removing
any that are no longer extant, either on request or because of an
error in the call).

But it may be that this comes down to a Windows lossage problem.  I've
just tried it on Linux, and now I get a `cannot bind port' error,
which is what I should get, I think, since the two ORBs can't coexist
on the same port.  What I got on Windows was ... nothing: initialising
the ORB worked fine, but then on the `client' it got completely mutant
errors (`this object does not exist') when trying to pass the
reference.  So I probably need to (a) give up on Windows (*how* are
you meant to tell, in Windows, if a port is in use or not?), and do
the `look for a free port' thing on Linux.

I've seen this before, and in fact, got Xanalys to put in a patch so
we got a sensible error early on.  A couple of things:

* You can specify which port your ORB should listen on, e.g.
  #+LispWorks4.2			; In 4.1, they do automatic port scanning.
  (when corba-port
    (setf corba:*poa-service-port* corba-port)
    (log-message :info "Launching CORBA service on port ~A" corba-port))

* instead of nameservice complications, to bootstrap yourself, you can
  get each application to write a file with the IOR to the entry
  object of that application, or get each app to open a trivial socket
  app to respond to requests for that IOR; once you've got this, you
  can have arbitrary N way comms between your various CORBA apps.

I have apps which basically do what you're asking for working here, so
inquire further if this isn't clear enough or sufficient.

Good luck.

It should work once you assign separate ports.

In other CORBA implementations there are Implementation Repositories
(activation daemons) which sit on the one and only fixed port in the
system and which manage the starting of all the other services on
OS-assigned port numbers.

But this seems to fail when trying to create the POA.  Am I confused

It turns out that I had also subclassed an x rather than an x-SERVANT
class, resulting in wonderful obscurity - registering the (narrowed)
object as a callback actually worked, but the callback then died with
a `something bad happened, somewhere, but I'm not going to tell you
what' error, made more exciting to debug by my code which catches
errors and deletes callback objects whose owners have gone away.

If anyone wants to look at the resulting horror, it lives at
http://www.tfeb.org/programs/clc.tar.gz.  What it is, is a command
line client for LW (or other Lisp with CORBA bindings), for which you
can define handlers within a Lisp.  We use it really a lot, as it lets
you drive things from Makefiles &amp;c.  It's fairly rudimentary use of
CORBA though, to say the least.

Thanks for everyone's help.
