                <h1>Delivered editor panes in 4.3 vs. 4.2</h1>
                <pre>Hi!

The following two programs basically have the same code but the first
one was delivered with LW 4.2.7, the second one with LW 4.3.6:

  &lt;http://weitz.de/files/regex-coach-0.5.4.exe&gt
  &lt;http://weitz.de/files/regex-coach.exe&gt

Both were delivered with the same delivery script (level 5) and the
EDITOR-COMMANDS-TO-KEEP keyword argument includes commands like
"Beginning Of Buffer Extending Selection" and "End Of Buffer Extending
Selection" which are available as Shift-HOME and Shift-END on
Windows. However, these commands are only available in the 4.2
version, none of the Shift commands to extend a selection work in the
4.3 version.

What's the reason for this? Do I have to check my code or is this a
known issue with 4.3? Maybe I have to provide more options to the
DELIVER function?

Thanks,
Edi.

AFAIK, in 4.3 these commands were renamed to
    "Beginning Of Buffer Modifying Selection" 
    "End Of Buffer Modifying Selection"

BTW, some people used to bind Shift-HOME to
    "Beginning of Line Modifying Selection"
:-)

Ahh, that must be it! I'll try it out. Thanks.

Really? It shows that I almost never use Windows.

Thanks again,
Edi.
