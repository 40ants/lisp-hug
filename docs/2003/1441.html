Hello,

I had gotten used to customizing my windows' color schemes with
capi:install-registered-values, which has apprently been purged from LW4.3.
I wasn't all that happy with messing the registry to set my window's color
anyway, but I would assume that there is now a better way to do that.
Which I have been unable to find.  Adding

(DEFMETHOD initialize-instance  :after ((pane capi:listener-pane) &amp;rest
args)
   (setf (capi:simple-pane-background pane) (color:make-rgb .8 .8 1.0)))

to my init-file would be acceptable, but I also want to do for
collector-pane and echo-area-pane.  I'm afraid I might step on the after
methods (either present or future) that CAPI provides itself for those
panes if I do that.

Mentioning that the function is no longer supported would have been a
useful addition to the release notes,  BTW.

Suggestions?
