                <h1>Adding pinboard-objects to a pinboard-layout</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

Suppose I have a lot of (say, 1000) pinboard-objects that I want to add to
a pinboard-layout. I want them to appear on top of the stuff that's already
in the layout. I think that using something like the following would be
the 'official way' to do this:

  (loop for object in pinboard-objects
        do (capi:manipulate-pinboard pinboard-layout object :add-top))

Unfortunately, this is too slow when I have a lot of these objects.
(I suppose I'm getting some quadratic time dependency on the number
of objects.)

The only alternative I can think of is to use:

  (setf (capi:layout-description pinboard-layout)
        (append (capi:layout-description pinboard-layout)
                pinboard-objects)))

This seems to work and it's lots faster, but I can't find anything in the
documentation that says that the appended pinboard-objects are actually on
top of what's already there. And it seems to defeat the purpose of CAPI's
MANIPULATE-PINBOARD function.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

Regards,

Arthur Lemmens

Hi,

did you tried putting you loop statement inside a "with-atomic-redisplay"
form ?
