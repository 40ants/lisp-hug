                <h1>a few lww questions</h1>
                <pre>1. Is there an easy (i.e. built-in...) way for an LWw-based application to 
   trigger a connection to the internet (like browsers and mail programs
   tend to do)?
2. How can I make a window float (stay on top)?

You mean other than by (require "comm") and COMM:OPEN-TCP-STREAM?
Make the user's modem dial automatically?  In Germany, we send
programmers to prison who do that ;-)

&gt 
&gt In theory you can do it on Windows, though the CAPI does not provide a
&gt way.
&gt 
&gt It isn't possible on Motif because there is no way to tell the window
&gt manager to do that.  The :OWNER argument to CAPI:DISPLAY might make a
&gt window stay above its owner, if the window manager works properly.

This isn't really dependent on Motif but on the window manager. Within
standard ICCCM it's fairly complicated but can be done by using
ConfigureWindow requests to change the window stack. The downside of
this is that you need to keep track of the window stack yourself. If
you use a more modern window manager (something gnome or kde
compliant) you can do it by setting the window type to floating.
