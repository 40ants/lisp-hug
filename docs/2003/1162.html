                <h1>stack overflow with regular expressions</h1>
                <pre>Hi.

When i try to use the pregexp regular expression library with Lispworks 
Personal Edition 4.2.0 for anything other than trivial matches, I get an 
error, either "Stack overflow (stack size 16000)" or "recursive stack 
overflow".   The same code works fine in CLISP.

Can someone tell me:
(1) whether or not i'm doing something wrong
(2) if this is a limitation of Lispworks
(3) if its a limitation of the personal edition
(4) if there is anything I can do about it?


Thanks.
larry

I think I had the same problem some time ago. 
Did you compile pregexp ?

You might be able to extend the stack, see

  &lt;http://www1.xanalys.com/support/lisp/kbase.nsf/51fe6e1cdfe748a180256639005a2ba9/f35acd8100dfd9ba8525670b0074a8d6?OpenDocument&gt

for an explanation. Don't know if this works with the Personal
Edition, though.

However, as you might know, pregexp is a CL program that was
auto-generated from a Scheme program and thus relies on tail-call
optimization (or whatever they call it nowadays). Maybe you'll have
more luck with "real" Common Lisp regex libraries like the one from
Michael Parker or (shameless self-plug) CL-PPCRE. See

  &lt;http://www.cliki.net/Regular%20Expression&gt

Good luck,
Edi.
