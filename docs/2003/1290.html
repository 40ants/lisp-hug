                <h1>Debugging emitting of function objects in compile-file</h1>
                <pre>Hello,

I am getting errors of the form below (the example below is copied from the 
lispworks knowledge base)

**++++ Error in (TOP-LEVEL-FORM 2):
System error 43 in function SYSTEM::DUMP-UNDUMPABLE-ERROR applied to 
(#&lt;function (SUBFUNCTION 1 DEF-FOOB1) 20622C82&gt #&lt;Fasl 
#&lt;STREAM::LATIN-1-FILE-STREAM C:\temp\foo.fsl&gt &gt):
      Don't know how to dump object.

unfortunately there are many levels of macro expansion and code generating 
and despite much
manual macro expansion, reading the code, changing the code, I have not 
figured out where the function objects are being emitted.

Also the error only occurs when the definitions are contained in the same 
file. If I create one file per definition, the above error does not occur.

i.e.
(load-file "all-definitions.lisp")
(compile-file "all-definitions.lisp")

exhibits the above error. But if a I put one definition per file and do.

(load-file "definitions-001.lisp")
(compile-file "definitions-001.lisp")
(load-file "definitions-002.lisp")
(compile-file "definitions-002.lisp")
(load-file "definitions-003.lisp")
(compile-file "definitions-003.lisp")

I don't get the error.

I assume this must be something to do with interactions between the 
definitons that for some
reason only occurs in the compiler enviroment and not in the evaluation 
enviroment?

I am wondering what is the best way to debug this is?

I have already spent several hows debugging this, but not very effectively.

Is there some way to jump into the debugger at the point the above error 
occurs? So that I can examine the call stack and see the values being passed 
between functions.

Rene.
