                <h1>Always CAPI: drawing a pinboard object.</h1>
                <pre>Hi

I created a new PINBOARD-OBJECT class following the example present in 
the "circled-graph-nodes" example.

Essentially I have a CIRCLED-ITEM that I want to display.

To achieve this effect I do

	(setf co (make-instance 'circled-item :text "Here we go" :x 10 :y 10))
	(manipulate-pinboard the-pinboard co :add-top)

So far so good.
Suppose now that I want to create an instance of the CIRCLED-ITEM that 
has a different color (of the ellipse).
I try

	(setf co (make-instance 'circled-item :text "Here we go" :x 10 :y 50 
:graphics-args (list :background :red)))
	(manipulate-pinboard the-pinboard co :add-top)

now things are not all so good, as I get red all over the bounding 
rectangle.

Does it mean that I have to munge the :graphics-args in 
INITIALIZE-INSTANCE to achieve the desired effect?  Is there a better 
way to do this?

Thanks

Marco

I haven't studied the example carefully, but, I think you want to make the 
*foreground* of the *filled* ellipse red.  The example draws two ellipses - 
one for the outline, one for the filling (if "background" is non-nil).  I 
think that this means that you want to send :red as the background colour 
to draw-text-in-ellipse.  One way would be to subclass text-in-ellipse and 
write new draw-pinboard-object-xxx routines.

Or subclass text-in-ellipse with a new slot for the fill colour, suitably 
modifying the draw-pinboard-object-xxx to use it.

I'm not sure what :graphics-args does, but I bet that it affects the whole 
pinboard object rectangle, instead of the component ellipses, hence, you 
get a red background for the whole rectangle.

It is this piece of code in draw-text-in-ellipse that causes the filled 
ellipse to have a colour:

(gp:draw-ellipse pinboard
                            circle-x circle-y
                            half-width half-height
                            :filled t
                            :foreground background)

Follow the variable "background" to see where it comes from and you will 
probably get other ideas on how to make it :red.
