                <h1>Another DELIVER warning</h1>
                <pre>Hi!

When I run a delivered CAPI program on another machine, I get a
warning

``Warning: Unable to find default fallback resources for application
  class Lispworks´´

According to strace, it tries to open

/usr/local/lib/LispWorks/lib/4-2-0-0/app-defaults/Lispworks

(but fails, of course).  Can I disable this behavior somehow?

Regards,

&gt    ``Warning: Unable to find default fallback resources for application

&gt 
&gt    According to strace, it tries to open
&gt 
&gt    /usr/local/lib/LispWorks/lib/4-2-0-0/app-defaults/Lispworks

&gt One solution is to have a resources file on the target machine as
&gt well, the idea is that the fallback resources are machine specific
&gt so won't you need that anyway? A different application class (for a
&gt different filename) can be specified in the call that opens the
&gt display e.g.
&gt 
&gt (capi:display (make-instance 'capi:interface) 
&gt 	      :screen '(:application-class "Nils"))

Seems to work fine; setting

   capi-motif-library:*default-application-class*

works, too.  However, the warning is still omitted unless I put the
file `Nils´ contaning the resources into the LispWorks tree.
According to strace, the warning is printed immediately after the file
isn't found in the LispWorks tree, even though my $HOME directory and
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults are also tried.

Not that this were terribly important, but maybe something for a
future version... :-)

&gt Another approach, if you want to hardwire the fallbacks, is to read
&gt the fallback resources at build time, and pass them when you open
&gt the display at runtime.
&gt 
&gt ;; at build time
&gt (setq *fallback-resources*  (xt-lib::fallback-resources "Lispworks"))
&gt 
&gt ;; at run time
&gt (capi:display (make-instance 'capi:interface) 
&gt 	      :screen `(:fallback-resources ,*fallback-resources*))
&gt 
&gt 
&gt Does that work for you?

Yes, this one works fine, thanks!

Uhm, make that ``emitted´´ :-)
