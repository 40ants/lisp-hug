Hi

ok.  This is what I end up getting with my implementation of Active 
Scripting Automation.

I am very, very close to getting it to work.

Please note that I have a deadline next wednesday (March 19th) to have 
this done at least as a show of feasability.  Let me repeat that this 
project is VITAL to the expanded use of Common Lisp in my lab (as well 
as possible future commercial ventures).

I managed to register all the necessary keys in the Window Registry, in 
order to make CLAXS (the .exe I deliver) known to COM as an Active 
Scripting Engine.

The class definition is below.  I couldn't make much sense out of the 
explanation given about the interplay between :COCLASS and :INTERFACES. 
So I may have done something wrong. (In particular factory registration 
is a rather mysterious process, as explained in the documentation).


&gt (com:define-automation-component active-script-impl (com:standard-i-dispatch)
&gt      ((script-site :accessor script-site
&gt                    :initform nil)
&gt       (script-state :accessor script-state
&gt                     :initform 'SCRIPTSTATE_UNINITIALIZED)
&gt       (named-items :accessor named-items
&gt                    :initform '())
&gt       (event-handlers :accessor event-handlers
&gt                       :initform '())
&gt       )
&gt      ;; Implemented interfaces
&gt      (:interfaces i-active-script i-active-script-parse)
&gt      )

Below is a trace of what happens when a C++ program launches the 
CLAX.exe program as an Automation server (I changed some formatting for 
readability).  Note that my understanding is that I should not need a 
type library for my component.

Well I would like to help, you but I just have struggeled with COM
myself and not graped it, I just can recommend to contact Xanalys
directly and ask for help. Maybe you better be prepared to pay for
their consultancy.

Friedrich
