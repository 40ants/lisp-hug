                <h1>capi - mouse to screen coords?</h1>
                <pre>I want to convert the mouse x/y to "screen" coordinates but don't see a 
function in the docs that looks like it will do the job (I'm probably 
missing something obvious :-).

I think that the mouse x/y sent to a capi mouse callback is 
pane-relative.  I position the mouse over an output pane, click and want to 
pop a new, separate window up where the mouse is.  The new window needs 
best-x/best-y that are relative to the screen, not the output-pane.

I think that I might be able to calculate the value I want by grabbing the 
top-level-interface-geometry and working from there (haven't sussed this 
out fully, so hints would be appreciated).  Is this the best way to get 
what I want?

thanks in advance

                  <h1>FAQ: (re)defining symbols visible from CL package</h1>
                  <pre>
Hi

this is probably a FAQ.

I am playing around with Norvig's code.  I stashed all of it in a 
package named "PAIP" (the original code assumes everything is put in 
the "CL-USER" package)

When I compile and load the code, I get a continuable error stating 
that I am redefinining a symbol visible from the CL package. (The 
symbol being 'SYMBOL :) ).  As it is SYMBOL is neither BOUNDP nor 
FBOUNDP.  Is there a way to override the LW behavior (meaning, by 
avoiding the generation of the continuable error)?

Thanks

Not a direct answer to your question - I simply renamed the offending symbols 
(3 of them, if I recall) in Norvig's code, then it compiled and ran.

&gt True, but it is defined in ANSI Common Lisp, as a system class. I hope
&gt the code is not trying to define a type or class of this name.

No. It is being defined as a function.  (FBOUNDP 'CL:SYMBOL) ==&gt NIL

&gt
&gt            Is there a way to override the LW behavior (meaning, by

&gt
&gt Yes - see
&gt http://www.lispworks.com/reference/lwm43/LWRM/html/lwref-168.htm
&gt
&gt But it would be better to shadow that name in your PAIP package.

Duh! :}


Cheers
