this is a bit embarassing, but how do I *copy* an object?

Well, if you are trying to copy an atom, copy-symbol is probably what 
you want (with
:copy-properties set to t).

You can do a search from the LW help menu partial match on 'copy' and 
you will
see different functions for copying sequences, lists, trees, etc.

happy hacking,

&gt How do I *copy* a CLOS object?

As others have pointed out this is in general an ill-defined notion
(for instance: how deeply should you copy it? do you want sharing of
structure to be preserved (which can be crucial)?  Can it be copied at
all (can a lock be copied?)?).  Generally what you want to do is make
a copy of an object *for some purpose* where the purpose is part of
the application, and you need to define methods for that purpose.

I think that, really, it's best to do this with special-purpose
copiers, since using up some general name (like COPY or something) is
really a bad idea since it implies that there's a well-defined notion
of copying when there isn't.

But if you want to use a generic name, I think the right approach
would be something like this:

(defgeneric copy-for (purpose object &amp;key)
  ;; Methods on this should be EQL on PURPOSE, and specialise on
  ;; OBJECT.  This GF should probably not exist...
  )

(defmethod copy-for ((purpose (eql 'shallow-standard-object))
                     (object standard-object)
                     &amp;key)
  ;; really anything with a reasonably standard MOP, modulo packages.
  ;; This is probably far from optimal
  #+LispWorks                           
  (loop with c = (class-of object)
        with new = (allocate-instance c)
        for s in (clos:class-slots c)
        for sn = (clos:slot-definition-name s)
        when (slot-boundp object sn)
        do (setf (slot-value new sn) (slot-value object sn))
        finally (return new)))

 &gt Dear Nils,

 &gt well the idea was to take a "snapshot" of an objects state, well the 
 &gt state of the slots, so at some later point in time it would be possible 
 &gt to "reset" that object.

Well, this is sufficiently frequent that the C++ crowd calls
this "The Memento Pattern".  But that's a fair cry from the
original "how do I copy an object" question.  In fact, the
Memento may hold only a small subset of the object's state,
depending on the application.

So, as others have said, canned solutions won't work: you'll
have to roll your own on a class-by-class basis.
