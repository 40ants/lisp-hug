I want to make my own button class to use it in a
button panel.  But :button-class seems to be ignored
even when I give it 'push-button.  The buttons shown
in the panel above are radio buttons.  Am I using
:button-class wrong?

                    <pre>I used the previous hints/suggestions to make a push
button panel which shouldn't accept focus.  The Lisp
code is below.  The result is that there is no
indication of focus on any of the buttons.  But that's
only temporary.  As soon as I press the tab key, one
of the buttons shows the visible indication of focus. 
And the space bar will then cause that button to show
itself being pressed, which is another indication of
focus.  But the visible indication of focus partly
disappears if the button redraws (e.g. after being
covered by another window temporarily.)  I also tried
setting the accepts-focus-p slots to nil, in both the
buttons and the panel, but that made no difference. 
What is the accepts-focus-p slot for if it uses the
accepts-focus-p method?  And what else should I do to
make it never accept focus at all, so the tab key will
always bypass all the buttons?

(defclass nf-push-button (push-button) ())

(defmethod accepts-focus-p ((x nf-push-button)) nil)

(contain
 (make-instance
  'button-panel
  :button-class 'nf-push-button
  :interaction :no-selection
  :items '(one two three)))

&gt As anybody succeeded on getting LWL 4.3 working on Debian Woody ?
&gt The Motif version is not the good one. It's 2.1 and LWL4.3 wants 2.2.

During the beta testing I got complaints from LWL about version 2.1, 
but it appeared to work anyway. Haven't had time to try 4.3 final yet :-(
