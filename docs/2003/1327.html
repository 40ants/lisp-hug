                <h1>Memory allocation and garbage collection</h1>
                <pre>
My Lisp doesn't cons enough.

When I'm developing my application, the lisp image generally only gets
to about 50 Meg, tops.

The problem is that my machine has 500 Meg of RAM and the delivery
platform will likely have a couple of Gig of RAM.  Since the image is
keeping itself small, it is spending far more time garbage collecting
than necessary.  In theory, if Lisp uses more memory, generational
scavenging will be far less frequent and far more effective because
short-lived objects will have more time to die.

I have played with the GC parameters, but there are some non-intuitive
behaviors.  It seems that these parameters should be relevant:

:enlarge-by-segments
    The default value of this is 10 (so the heap grows in 640K chunks)
    I've increased this a bit, and it does seem to make lisp grab
    bigger chunks when it has to, but since lisp is reluctant to grab
    memory at all, it doesn't help much.

:minimum-for-promote
:minimum-for-sweep
    These parameters control the `promotion' and how often `sweeping'
    is done.  When I crank these values up a curious thing happens:
    The GC does indeed run less frequently, but I find that my program
    grinds to halt!  From the look of it, there is some sort of linear
    process going on during allocation.  When I set these values
    really high, the rate at which I can cons gets slower and slower
    until it takes forever to cons anything.


I'm afraid that the documentation for the GC is rather opaque.
I know what all the terms mean, but I don't understand how the
various pieces fit together.

Ideally, I'd like this to be the case:

  1.  Lisp is allowed to take up a substantial amount of memory.
      I'm going to be manipulating a *lot* of objects, and I expect
      to keep the entire address space in RAM.

  2.  The youngest generation is `scavenged' or `collected' or
      whatever you call it on the order of once every few seconds.
      I expect that over 95% of the new objects will die in that time.
      You should be able to cons hundreds of megabytes of storage
      in this generation without collecting.  I want the objects
      that survive to be promoted because I don't want to scan them
      over and over at this level.

  3.  The next youngest generation is collected maybe every 10 minutes
      or so.  I don't exect it to be anywhere near as efficient as
      the highest generation, so maybe it can only reclaim 30% - 50%

  4.  The bottom generation is collected maybe once an hour, if that.

Any advice on how to set the GC parameters to maximize performance
and to maximize the utilization of RAM? (Hey, I spent money on that
RAM, I want to use it!)  Any clue why larger parameters cause performance
to drop so horribly?  What on earth are the other GC parameters for?
How should I determine what to twiddle and tweak?  Some detailed
explanation into the algorithms behind the GC would be nice.
For instance, do objects ever move?  How does the allocator decide
where to put objects?  How does the allocator decide when to trigger
a GC?  How does the GC decide where to look for freeable objects?
Is there coalescing going on?

Thanks for your time.
