                <h1>changing focus</h1>
                <pre>I have an interface that has two panes that might accept keyboard input.  I 
would like to change the focus programmatically.

I thought that capi:activate-pane would do the trick, but it doesn't seem to 
do so (under LWL).

What is the correct way to change focus between two panes within the same 
interface?

I have included a simple example of what I think doesn't work.  It has two 
text-input-panes within the same interface.  Type "(run)", then "(sel1)" and 
"(sel2)" should select the two different panes (but don't, at least under my 
linux).

Thanx
pt



(in-package cl-user)

(defvar *xx*)

(capi:define-interface junk ()
  ()
  (:panes
   (text-input-pane-1
    capi:text-input-pane
    :accessor pane1)
   (text-input-pane-2
    capi:text-input-pane
    :accessor pane2))
  (:layouts
   (column-layout-1
    capi:column-layout
    '(text-input-pane-1 text-input-pane-2)))
  (:default-initargs
   :best-height 116
   :best-width 308
   :layout 'column-layout-1
   :title "junk"))

(defun run ()
  (setq *xx* (capi:contain (make-instance 'junk))))

(defun sel1 ()
  (capi:activate-pane (pane1 *xx*)))

(defun sel2 ()
  (capi:activate-pane (pane2 *xx*)))
