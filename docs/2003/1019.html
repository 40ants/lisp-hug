                <h1>arglist on space</h1>
                <pre>MCL and ilisp have a feature that automatically shows the arglist at 
the bottom of the editor buffer when a space is typed after a 
function call. Is there something similar in LispWorks? I can't seem 
to find it.

Thanks,

John DeSoi, Ph.D.

                  <pre>An alternative method below. I prefer this because it gives immediate 
feedback when you are typing - you know right away if you have 
mistyped a function name because the arglist does not show up. This 
version just looks at symbols after "(" -- it was distracting to see 
the arglist after typing "if" in a comment :). The original version 
would only show the arglist for functions in other packages if they 
had a package qualifier. That is resolved in this function using 
find-symbol.

I could not find a documented way to get the package for the point, 
but I did find editor::buffer-package-to-use in the editor source. Is 
there a better method?

One other question. All the Lisp editors I have used indent the if 
and else forms of an if expression at the same level. LispWorks 
out-dents the else form. Is there an easy way to change that?

Thanks,

John DeSoi, Ph.D.
