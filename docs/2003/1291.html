                <h1>Installing default handlers for CAPI applications</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

I'm currently putting the finishing touches on a CAPI (Win32) application
for a client of mine, and as part of this I'd like to install "default"
handlers for errors and warnings.

Is there any simple way in LW to achieve this?  The most obvious way I can
think of would be to wrap the given handlers around the message-loop in
each interface's process, however this brings up the question of how I'd
manually construct a valid CAPI message-loop process, given that this
isn't documented AFAIK, and involves internal symbols in the CAPI package
(capi::run-in-process??).

Another option would be general hooks into the condition signalling
process, which is trivial for errors (cl:*debugger-hook*) but not so for
warnings.

Of course in the worst case I could establish the various handlers around
each an every callback, etc. manually, but this seems tedious.

Given that this isn't all that unusual to do, it seems to me I must be
missing something obvious, so any advice would be most welcome...

Regs, Pierre.

&gt Hi,

&gt handlers for errors and warnings.

I always wrap things I give to execute-with-interface in a handler-case 
(Remember that you can use (warning (cond) ...) clauses in handler-case).

I assume you also want to capture _everything_ that goes wrong.
Here we use the following (where you define FATAL-ERROR-HANDLER as
you like):

(lw:defadvice (capi::call-and-process-events handle-capi-thread-error :around)
      (function interface finished-notify args)
    (handler-bind ((error 'fatal-error-handler))
      (lw:call-next-advice function interface finished-notify args)))

I think my colleague got this from Xanalys support before I started working
with CAPI, maybe someone from Xanalys cares to comment whether this is
kosher or not.

Ok, I was just guessing!

thanks!

I just noticed that the top-level-hook seems to be useless on
Mac OS X.

Is this because of the fact that all interfaces run
in the single Cocoa thread?

Is it a bug? If not, is there by chance any workaround?

thanks, that was what I thought, too, but I can't get it to work,
if I build an image with mp:*process-initial-bindings* (or the
global binding of *debugger-hook*) set this way, the cocoa thread
seems to ignore it (does it bind *debugger-hook* to nil itself..?))
