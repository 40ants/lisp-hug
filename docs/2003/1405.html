                <h1>Saving from the listener</h1>
                <pre>Hello everyone,

is it possible to save all the stuff you've developed in the listener. I
mean let's presume I wouldn't use the editor for developing but rather
typing everything into the listener.

Developing starting with "defpackage...", "in-package..." and so on, at
some point I would like to save the package somehow.

I just got my LWW 4.3 Pro and printed most of the documentation, but I
couldn't find a hint on how to do this. The documentation seems to
suggest to use the editor instead putting everything into files. Which
is exactly what I do not want to do. I mean the interactive development
(the listener) is one of the best things about Lisp, why using the
editing files, compile, run approach?

I'm new to both CL and LWW.

Thanks upfront

Guenther

Look up the function SAVE-IMAGE in the LW reference manual, this is
more or less what you're looking for. ("More or less" because it
won't, for example, save your listener history IIRC.)

You can write your definitions into files and still work interactively
- you don't have to LOAD a whole file at once. For example, you can
put the cursor behind a DEFUN form and then type C-x C-e (for
"Evaluate Last Form") - now the corresponding function is defined in
your image. Or use "Compile Defun" (not bound to a key sequence by
default) or similar functionality. See the "Editor User Guide."

Great! Much fun ahead for you!

Good luck,
Edi.

                   <pre>Hello guys

How to get password like input for text based (e.g. non-gui) delivered 
application? I guess there might be special functions doing this.

Thanks

&gt
&gtDo you mean you want to hide the input? That would be something for
&gtthe shell that runs the application to do, wouldn't it? 
&gt  
&gt
What I want to get is something like read*-without-echo, I think. The 
application has all the validation logic already and will be run on both 
Windows and Linux. So I prefer writing lisp program rather than shell 
script.

&gtLispWorks does provide CAPI:PASSWORD-PANE for GUI applications.
&gt
Yes, but this is not a GUI application, yet.

It would be nice (in a theoretical sort of way) to have a
WITHOUT-ECHOING or something like that, so you could say

(without-echoing (s)
 (read-line s))

which would do all the ioctl nausea on Unix and some equivalent horror
on other systems.  I've found myself wanting this, but not enough to
investigate how it could be done.

(without-echoing (s :echo #\*)
 ...)

would ne nice too.
