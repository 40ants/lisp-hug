                <h1>Adding commands to LispWorks toplevel</h1>
                <pre>Greetings. Is it possible to add user-defined commands to the LispWorks
toplevel? For example, I might want to add a :PA command that changes
packages. This capability is available in Allegro, and since LispWorks is
such a stellar product I'm sure I've overlooked something. Thanks...

IIRC Tim Bradshaw had example code which did exactly this but
unfortunately his very informative and interesting Lisp stuff which
could once be found at

  &lt;http://www.tfeb.org/lisp/&gt

seems to be gone now. (Damn! Two or three weeks ago I almost grabbed
the whole stuff with wget to have an offline copy but for some reason
didn't do it.)

Maybe he's reading this and can provide an alternative location.

Er, wait... Google might have cached it........... Yep!

  &lt;http://216.239.57.100/search?q=cache:4Bkr63s0djYJ:www.tfeb.org/lisp/implementation-hax.html+site:tfeb.org+lisp&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;client=googlet&gt

Or, if that doesn't work, search Google for

  "site:tfeb.org implementation hacks"

However, Google doesn't seem to cache the Lisp files... :(

HTH,
Edi.

I will put up an archived version of this stuff, probably later this
week.  The URL will be the same.
