                <h1>Looking for Mac OS X maintainer of "Regex Coach"</h1>
                <pre>The following message is a courtesy copy of an article
that has been posted to comp.lang.lisp as well.

Some of you may know my little freeware app "The Regex Coach"[1] which
I've made available for Windows and Linux. Obviously, because it's a
"stand-alone" binary, you need a LW pro license to create it. I have
pro licenses for Windows and Linux but not for Mac OS X, but I've
gotten lots of request for a Mac version.

In the last week I've "ported" the program to LW 4.3 (which was
necessary because I used some undocumented features of 4.2) and it
should now be possible to compile it for OS X. Xanalys was so nice to
give me an evaluation version so I can use my wife's old (and slow,
sigh) PowerBook to prepare an initial OS X version. However, this
evaluation version won't last forever, so if I release a Mac version
to the public I'll need someone to "maintain" it, i.e. this person
would basically just have to re-compile and re-deliver the app if I
make changes to the sources (which doesn't happen to often - about
five releases since May).

Extra bonus points for making a nice package out of it which would
involve coping with Mac-specific things I don't know of like an
installer (or rather DMG I suppose) or an icon.

Of course, you won't get rich with this because it's freeware. But
eternal fame is guaranteed... :)

Send me an email if you're interested.

Thanks in advance,
Edi.
