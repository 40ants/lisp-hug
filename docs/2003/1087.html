                <pre>
Hi,

I'm using lispworks 4.2.7 under WinXP and a native win32 XEmacs
(21.5.11). The current version of ilisp I got from the sumo tarball
XEmacs pacakges doesn't seem to work well. There is an error when the
ilisp/lispworks.lisp is loaded into lispworks because the package
"ilisp" is not defined. The big problem is that once there is an error,
both xemacs and lispworks start eating cpu (xemacs wins at first, but
once killed, lispworks takes it all).

Anybody managed to run such a configuration ? 

Thanks in advance,

&gt Sounds like you've not loaded ILISP into LispWorks. Did you read the
&gt guide in the file INSTALLATION in the ILISP distribution?

Well, yes, I  presume  that the ilisp-pkg.lisp  and  cl-ilisp.lisp files
have  not   been loaded, but   xemacs  packages  are   supposed to  come
preconfigured. I set up a couple of  variables, loaded ilisp and started
an a lisp (console mode only). If there were only an  error at startup I
could have tried to  debug it. But given  that both lisp and  xemacs are
stuck eating cpu, I just can kill them (no reaction to any signal). Will
try to investigate a bit more.
