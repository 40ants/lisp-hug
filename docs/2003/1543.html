                 <h1>Re: LW (OS X) questions</h1>
                 <pre>

   Our research team here at Sibelius Academy, Finland, has been 
   developing a visual programming language called PWGL (based on Lisp and 
   OpenGL) for a few years now. We have also developed a music notation 
   program called ENP (also with LISP and OpenGL), a musical constraint 
   satisfaction programs, a software synthesis package, etc. All having a 
   Lisp based GUI and high level control. We have been MCL users for over 
   a decade now and only recently switched from MCL to LispWorks in OS X. 
   So far we have been concentrating on learning the new Lisp-system and 
   porting our existing code to LispWorks. Things are shaping up quite 
   nicely at the moment. We already have pretty much all the code ported. 
   There are, however, some questions that come to mind.

   1) About key gestures. Here's some example code to I have tried to run:

	   defclass type-in-pane(capi:output-pane)
	     ())

	   (capi:define-interface interface-event-handler-mixin ()
	     ()
	     (:panes (type-in-pane type-in-pane
			    :min-width 200
			    :min-height 100
			    :input-model '((:character 
   capi-interface-key-event-handler))  ; or (:key :press)
			    :reader type-in-pane)))

	   (defmethod capi-interface-key-event-handler((self type-in-pane) x y 
   char)
	     (capi:display-tooltip self :x x :y y :text (format () "You 
   typed:~%~s" char))
	     (print char))

	   (capi:display (make-instance 'interface-event-handler-mixin))


   Should the code above print (and give tooltip) for every character 
   typed? 

Yes. 

         Only ones I keep getting are some special keys (e.g., Return, 
   Escape, ETX etc.). I have not seen any, for example, alphabetic 
   characters yet, unless I hold down the &lt;Control&gt key.
   If this is the correct behaviour what would be the method to get an 
   individual key press (say pressing just 'a') to get through?

It's a bug and will be patched.

However we want to move away from :CHARACTER in the input-model (since
the character bit attributes used to reprsent modifers are not
portable) and the new approach will be the currently undocumented
:GESTURE-SPEC which portable supports modifiers.

This works for me in LispWorks for Macintosh 4.3.6:

(capi:define-interface interface-event-handler-mixin2 ()
  ()
  (:panes (type-in-pane type-in-pane
                        :min-width 200
                        :min-height 100
                        :input-model 
                        '((:gesture-spec
                           capi-interface-key-event-handler2))  ; or (:key :press)
                        :reader type-in-pane)))

(defmethod capi-interface-key-event-handler2((self type-in-pane) x y 
                                            gspec)
  (let ((charstring (with-output-to-string (ss) 
                      (sys::print-pretty-gesture-spec gspec ss))))
    (capi:display-tooltip self :x x :y y 
                          :text (format () "You typed:~%~a" charstring))
    (print charstring)))

(capi:display (make-instance 'interface-event-handler-mixin2))


   2) There are some cases in our software that we need to know about the 
   size and position of some windows that are by default hidden. For 
   example:

	   (defparameter *test-interface* (make-instance 'capi:interface :width 
   100 :height 200))

	   (multiple-value-bind (x y w h)
	       (capi:top-level-interface-geometry *test-interface*))

   ---------- ERROR -----------
   No applicable methods for #&lt;STANDARD-GENERIC-FUNCTION
   CAPI-LIBRARY:REPRESENTATION-INTERFACE-GEOMETRY
   10330822&gt with args (NIL)
   ----------------------------

   What would be the proper way to get the position and size of a window 
   that is not 'displayed'?

The terms 'hidden' and 'not displayed' are not really equivalent.
Here's how I'd do it:

(defparameter *test-interface* 
  (capi:display (make-instance 'capi:interface 
                               :width 100 :height 200 
                               :display-state :hidden)))

(capi:execute-with-interface 
     *test-interface*
     #'(lambda (interface)
         (multiple-value-bind (x y w h)
            (capi:top-level-interface-geometry interface)
           (print (list x y w h ))))
     *test-interface*)

(capi:execute-with-interface *test-interface*
       #'(setf capi:top-level-interface-display-state) 
       :normal *test-interface*)


   3) (capi:prompt-for-directory "Choose Directory:") returns the pathname 
   correctly when called from a Listener window. When I evaluate this in 
   an Editor, however, it returns NIL?

It looks like this is problem in Cocoa (or the way the we are using
it) when the dialog is standalone rather than dropping down from a
window. It should work provided that there is a window for the dialog
to drop down from.

   4) Also (using Finnish keyboard layout) it is impossible to save a file 
   with a euro sign in it! ERROR: #\Â€ is not of type BASE-CHAR.

This is caused by the default external format of the buffer being
:LATIN-1.  You can switch to another encoding e.g. :MACOS-ROMAN,
:UNICODE, or :UTF-8, by configuring LispWorks as follows:

;; This makes the editor choose UTF-8 when reading files
(setf (editor:variable-value "Input Format Default")
      ':utf-8)

;; This makes the editor write UTF-8 LF-terminated files
(setf (editor:variable-value "Output Format Default")
      '(:utf-8 :eol-style :lf))

You can also use Meta+X Set External Format in the editor to change
the setting for the current buffer.


   5) And finally... if you type a colon (:) in an editor as the first 
   character the LW seems to freeze?

That's a known bug, will be patched.

   Sorry about the lengthy message ;-)


   Kind regards,

   BTW. Dave Fox, I recently did seem to have trouble sending a bug report 
   (I keep getting Mail undeliverable messages) so there are some things 
   here that I tried to make a bug report of but failed.

We are not aware of any problem receiving mail at
lisp-support@xanalys.com (and we get plenty of it). Do show me the
bounce message if it looks like something went wrong at our end.
