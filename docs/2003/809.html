                <h1>Job in Munich, Germany</h1>
                <pre>I work for a consulting firm working with HypoVereinsbank in Munich Germany.
I extend existing equity derivative systems. I have been asked to find
someone to work with me. This job requires relocation to Munich. German
language skills are absolutely unnecessary.

We expect, in the next year, to do interesting work with parallel
programming and partial evaluation (and likely some ML).

The legacy product is in the process of being extended so that we can
control it via Lisp and other similar dynamic languages. The new projects
will likely be independent of the legacy system, and likely mostly written
in Common Lisp.

A huge part of this job is problem solving in anenvironment that we do not
control much. 

This job requires a lot rigorous methods (e.g. program transformation),
abstract thinking and problem solving, working with other systems (e.g.
Excel, legacy systems), and lots of hacking. Much of the existing code is
C++, and the people who wrote these quite disorganized programs are not
around anymore.

If you are interested, please send me information about yourself. No MIME
attachments or MSWord documents please:
