                <h1>Tab order in CAPI grid layouts</h1>
                <pre>
Hi,

I have a CAPI interface with a couple of multiple-choice questions
(implemented as radio-button-panels). The questions should have
the following layout (you'll need a fixed-width font for this):

  question 1         question 5
   answer a           answer a
   answer b           answer b
                      answer c
                      answer d

  question-2         question-6
   answer a           answer a
   answer b           answer b
   answer c

  question-3         question-7
   answer a           answer a
   answer b           answer b
   answer c           answer c

  question-4         question-8
   answer a           answer a
   answer b           answer b
                      answer c


In other words: the questions should be aligned both horizontally
and vertically. As far as I know, the only way to get this kind
of double alignment is by using CAPI's grid-layout. This works
fine, as far as layout is concerned.

But my problem is: I want the tab order for the questions to
follow the question numbering. The tab should jump from question 1
to 2 to 3 to 4 to 5 etc. But the grid-layout seems to impose a
row-by-row and then column-by-column tab ordering; the tab jumps
from question 1 to 5 to 2 to 6 etc.

I can get the tab order I want by using a row-layout containing
two column-layouts (each containing 4 questions). But then I don't
get horizontal aligment between question 1 and 5, 2 and 6, etc.

(I can't change the layout of the questions to
   1  2
   3  4
   5  6
   7  8
because I want the layout on the screen to follow the layout of
the paper forms on which the screen is based.)

Thanks a lot for any suggestions.

Arthur Lemmens

There are various initargs you can use for each column
layout.  E.g. :uniform-size-p t and :gap 20 or some
such combination might be just what you need.  Or
maybe explicitly size each question.
