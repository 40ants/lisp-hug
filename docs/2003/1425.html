                <pre>In addition to the links that Edi mentioned, Wade Huneniuk has released
the source to a number of his CAPI utilities and you might want to look
at them as well. Here are some of them:

1. Simple crossword display:
http://www3.telus.net/public/whumeniu/crossword.lisp
Note: just load the file and evaluate the following sexp in LW:
(capi:display (make-instance 'crossword))

2. Package browser:
http://www3.telus.net/public/whumeniu/package-browser.lisp
Note: just load the file and evaluate the following sexp in LW:
(package-browser:package-browser)

3. Runners Log: http://www3.telus.net/public/whumeniu/
Note: This page has a link to a self-extracting executable for Windows.
In the past, Wade has indicated that he would send the source to
individuals who request it by email.

Also, I presume that you have already looked at the capi examples in the
examples directory that ships with LW?

&gt &gt thanks again for your advice. I was indeed looking for LW (CAPI) 
&gt &gt specific stuff, wether in Source or not jut too see what all is 
&gt &gt possible (CAPI-wise). Would you happen to know of some sort of Link 
&gt &gt list or repository?
&gt 
&gt No, but I know three CAPI apps you might want to look at:
&gt 
  &lt;http://www.rocketdownload.com/details/Self/6724.htm&gt

Thanks for the post.

There is also

http://www3.telus.net/public/whumeniu/time-is-money.lisp
A time is money clock.  Mostly for humorous value, tested on
LWW.  Load file and then (time-is-money::time-is-money)

http://www3.telus.net/public/whumeniu/ybbil-capi.zip
A Logo (ladybugs and aphids) like program.  You will
have to search through the files, load the right ones and
execute the test programs.

The runner's log program is by far the most involved and my first
attempt at using  LW and CAPI. I just dove right in
and (to me) much of the code now looks naive.  The source is
available by sending me an email with some statement that you
will not use it.  The runner's log is free to download and also
received a short write up in Zdnets monthly magazine (it
was a while ago).
