                <pre>I'm getting some annoying extra blank lines when using
PPRINT-LOGICAL-BLOCK.

I have these definitions:

vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv 

(defparameter *stream* *standard-output*)

(defun test-no-logical-block ()
  (format *stream* "~&amp;aaaa~%")
  (format *stream* "~&amp;bbbb~%")
  (format *stream* "~&amp;cccc~%"))

(defmacro with-pprint-logical-block (&amp;body body)
  `(pprint-logical-block
       (*stream*
        nil
        :per-line-prefix ";;; ")
     ,@body))

(defun test-with-logical-block ()
  (with-pprint-logical-block
    (test-no-logical-block)))

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TEST-NO-LOGICAL-BLOCK behaves as I expect (# indicates
printed stuff):

(test-no-logical-block)
# aaaa
# bbbb
# cccc
-&gt NIL 


TEST-WITH-LOGICAL-BLOCK adds annoying extra blank lines
(FWIW, the behaviour is the same whether *PRINT-PRETTY* is
True or False.)

(test-with-logical-block)
# ;;; 
# ;;; aaaa
# ;;; 
# ;;; bbbb
# ;;; 
# ;;; cccc
# ;;; 
-&gt NIL 


Are these extra blank lines permitted or is this a bug?

I'm using LispWorks for Windows, 4.2 and 4.3 Beta.

Try using ~_ (pprint-newline) with and without modifiers instead of
~&amp;. It probably interacts better with pprint-logical-block.

    Simon&gt Thanks for the suggestion. I've had a look at the Hyperspec and a
    Simon&gt play, but I don't think ~_ does what I want.

    Simon&gt I'd been hoping to simply add uses of a WITH-INDENTATION macro
    Simon&gt to existing code so that I could indent blocks of printed output
    Simon&gt nicely:


    Simon&gt (defmacro with-indentation ((stream n &amp;optional (c #\space))
    Simon&gt                             &amp;body body)
    Simon&gt   `(pprint-logical-block
    Simon&gt        (,stream
    Simon&gt         nil
    Simon&gt         :per-line-prefix (make-string ,n :initial-element ,c))
    Simon&gt      ,@body))


    Simon&gt Perhaps there's another way to write a WITH-INDENTATION macro?
    Simon&gt Hmmmm.
    Simon&gt Perhaps I could define my own stream class that:
    Simon&gt - knows about the current indentation level
    Simon&gt - passes output on to a "real" stream
    Simon&gt - makes modifications according to the current indentation level.

As it happens that's exactly what I did myself in Java on a project.

Prettyprinting is a different (more advanced) concept. It is concerned
with filling a page with structured output and working out when best
to put in line breaks. Indenting is then necessary to visually
associate the parts of the structure after such line breaks.

That said, I have recently used pprint-logical-block to do some
indenting. I had more success in LW with PPRINT-INDENT than
:PER-LINE-PREFIX. Unfortunately, the same code in CLISP produced very
different (and inferior) output.

    Simon&gt When I find time I'll take a look at the documentation for defining
    Simon&gt ones own streams.

    Simon&gt For the moment I've simply changed my code to get most of what I want
    Simon&gt in a different (and more hacky) way.

                  <pre>I have a PrettyPrinter implementation in Java.  It implements all of CL 
API sans the macros.

If anybody is interested I will resurrect it.

It is a porting of CMUCL version
