                <h1>zip/gzip/LZ77</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

Taking up a new programming environment is sometimes a challenge, to 
me, and it looks like to everyone around me :-)

I've been looking for a way to read and write gziped streams from LW. 
No luck so far. I've found Allegro's deflate.cl but this only reads. 
Searching with google pretty much only finds the Allegro package in 
Debian and Gentoo (pages and pages), and advanced search doesn't help.

Is this supported in LW out of the box? If not, does anyone know how to 
add the functionality?

(BTW, LispWorks folks, it would be really nice if there was an inverted 
index for your documentation along the lines of the hyperspec, even 
nicer if the various keywords were indexed too)

Thanks,
Bob

OK, Marc Battyani's cl-pdf has a UFFI mapping to zlib (and several 
others in the cl-pdf contrib directory). This looks as though it should 
work on OS/X, Windows, and Linux.

There is a zlib binding for compression in cl-pdf.
But it's only a one shot compression, not a stream so if you write or find
something, I'm interested.

                  <pre>Thanks Marc. In the interval between my posting the query an receiving 
this I remembered your package (there's a message to that effect 
crossing paths with this one right now :-).

I'll be sure to pass anything I find or write in this regard on to you.

Cheers,
Bob
