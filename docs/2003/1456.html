                <h1>Object Storage - Data Persistence</h1>
                <pre>Hello everyone,

a couple of days ago I outed myself on this list as a LISP beginer and 
asked some CAPI questions (which thanks to help from list members I am 
getting the hang of).

If I needed an embedded object / data / structure storage system which 
one would you recommend?

I am aware of the PLOB, which unfortunately isn't pure CL, but no others 
at this time.

How do you guys handle large amounts of data, without an RDBMS at hand?

Cheers Guenther

What kind of data and how much (ballpark, order of magnitude) ?

You might look at

http://www.cliki.net/Database

to get an idea of what is available.

Depending on the type of data I have found that just using the Lisp
reader and printer to store persistent data in files is many times all
you need.  Arrange the files into some directory/naming structure
and go from there.

<br><font size=2 face="sans-serif">A very interesting approach is &quot;prevalence.&quot;
With prevalence you capture state from time to time and log commands that
change that state. You can find out about it here:</font>
