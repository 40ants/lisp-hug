                <h1>Bezier curves</h1>
                <pre>Hi!

I assume that none of you happens to use CLIM or did use CLIM, but I'll 
post my question anyway.

We use LWL 4.2.7 for Linux and due to some old code and preferences are
stuck with using CLIM for graphical presentation. We might change this
someday to CAPI which is better documented (and supported), but all in 
all CLIM doesn't work too bad.

Here's the problem: we would like to draw bezier curves.
When typing in (apropos 'bezier) after start-up, the result includes
clim:draw-bezier-curve and
clim:draw-bezier-curve*
So, it seems that they are theoretically there somewhere in the system;
and they are present in the CLIM documentation for Allegro Lisp (which 
is a different thing of course).

I assume that we need to include an
require("something")
in our code, just like with postscript support for CLIM. But I couldn't
figure out yet what this "something" might be.

Any ideas?

Thanks,

Kai-Florian
