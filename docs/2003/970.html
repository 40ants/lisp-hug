                <h1>default background color and font?</h1>
                <pre>Hi!

I'm currently working on a CAPI app which is supposed to be used on
Windows and Linux. While it looks quite OK with the default settings
on Windows I don't really like it on Linux.

Is there a way to change the default background color and the default
font CAPI elements are using? I tried APROPOS for "default" but
couldn't find anything that looked like it would be useful.

Thanks,
Edi.

You need to change the application defaults.  LW comes with a suitable
app defaults file (somewhere under .../lib I think) which has many
entries.  You should also be able to programmatically provide
`fallback' resources as strings, but I'm not quite sure how that
works.

                 <pre>Same here.

LW for Linux should come with a XApp/Xdefaults-like set of specs 
resempbling the much better looking defaults on Windows.  Just changing 
some of the pinkish colors you get as a default (a Motif legacy) and 
the main font will help.


Cheers
