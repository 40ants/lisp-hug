                <h1>Straight Win32 SDK Lispworks FLI Hello World Example</h1>
                <pre>Hello,

I posted a query about getting off the ground with a
Win32 SDK FLI program. Paul Tarvydas and Marc Battyani
were kind enough to reply. Paul, something in your
initial post got me going enough to find
fli:make-pointer, which Marc soon pointed out to me. I
was going full steam in that direction so I haven't
dug into your (Paul's) example code yet. I start on
your code tonight, though, as I have completed the
pure Lisp/FLI example.

The completed sample program is at 

http://www.jeffcaldwell.com 

which is a slash site. I really would like to move
that site to a better URL, maybe "lispslash.org" or
something, if that's not yet taken. I also have a wiki
started. It's clear to me now that the slash site
(temporal nature) needs a cooperating wiki site
(static nature) and I should have that all up and
going in the next week or two. 

Please take a look. Please suggest a better URL or
suggest anything else that needs suggesting. I'm
willing to learn.

Thanks again for your help.

Jeff
