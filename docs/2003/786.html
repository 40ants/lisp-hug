                <h1>Iteration syntax for UncommonSQL</h1>
                <pre>Hi!

(I'm currently using UncommonSQL because I only have a license for LW
professional but I'm sending a copy to the LW mailing list because I
guess the answer is indepent of whether it's "Uncommon" or "Common".)

I'm using the OO interface to UncommonSQL and have created a view
class USER which maps to a database table USERS. Everything works fine
except for the fact that, in order to loop through all elements of the
database, I resort to things like

  (dolist (user (sql:select 'user))
    ..)

which conses up a list that I don't actually need (and which might be
large).

I'm aware of the iteration constructs described in
&lt;http://www.lispworks.com/reference/sql-tutorial/index.html#section-4.3&gt
but I couldn't figure out how to use them with view classes.

Is there something that I'm missing?

Thanks,
Edi.

&gt Edi,
&gt 
&gt Take a look at the end of section 5.2 in the same document:
&gt 
&gt     Finally, we have at our disposal all the same iteration constructs
&gt     that we had before (section 4.3). This time the iteration focus is
&gt     not a record (i.e. a tuple of attributes) but a tuple of
&gt     instances. For example, returning to the iteration examples we
&gt     used before:
&gt 
&gt        CL-USER 361 &gt (do-query ((my-aardvark) [select 'species-list
&gt                                                       :where aardvark])
&gt                                (print my-aardvark))
&gt 
&gt        #&lt;db-instance SPECIES-LIST 574209404&gt
&gt 
&gt        CL-USER 362 &gt
&gt 
&gt I have only tried this with Common SQL. Please let us know if you find
&gt that UncommonSQL is different.

That was how I hoped it would work. But it doesn't (CMUCL 18e-pre with
USQL checked out from CVS in December):

                 <pre>To provide an update to this: I recently updated my CVS version of
UncommonSQL and it _looks_ like they also support DO-QUERY for view
class objects now. I can't verify this because the current version
didn't build for me and at the moment I don't have the time to dig
around in the sources until it does.

However, it also seems that the implementation of DO-QUERY does
exactly what I originally wanted to avoid: It first stores the
complete result of the query and then uses an iteration construct (DO
in this case) to walk through it. I think/hope that the original
CommonSQL doesn't do this.

(Please note that these observations are just based on a superficial
glance at the code. Please correct me if I'm wrong.)

Edi.
