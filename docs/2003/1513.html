                <h1>C Function pointers in FLI</h1>
                <pre>Hi

Suppose you have something like

typedef struct _foo {
	int (* fPtr)(int foo, double **result);
} foo;

How would you render it in FLI?

Thanks

Marco

Perhaps there's an undocumented way that is better than the FLI 4.3
manual. But reading that manual, the best I can come up with is:

(fli:define-c-struct foo
  (f-ptr (:pointer :void)))

Do you need to call the C function pointed to you by fPtr? I'm not
sure any CL implementations allow the calling of a function pointed to
by an address. The only ways I've seen to setup a C call is via macro
which is based on the name of the function rather than its address.
If you need to do this, perhaps you can write some C glue which takes
the fPtr address as well as the actual arguments of the function.

                 <pre>Hi,

search the FLI manual for FLI:DEFINE-FOREIGN-FUNCALLABLE. There is also 
a sample.

Thanks, it looks almost what I need.  This is only in 4.3 isn't it?  I 
could not find it in the 4.2.x docs.

This sure sounds familiar (for 4.2.7), but I haven't found a piece of my 
source using it, yet.  Just go ahead and try it.
