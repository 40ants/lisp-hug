                <h1>OT: ODBC on MacOS</h1>
                <pre>Hi

I know that this is OT, but let me ask you anyway.

I want to connect to an ODBC data source on MacOS.  I found the ODBC 
manager in the Applications/Utilities folder, but it seems I do not 
have the proper drivers installed (meaning: the openlinksw one I tried 
does not seem to work).  Does anybody know what could be a good driver 
for PostgresSQL under MacOS?  Is the Openlinksw the only one?

Thanks

Marco

                 <pre>Marco,

I spent the good part of the morning mucking around with this a few 
days ago. I finally found the PostgreSQL driver, got it compiled, and 
figured out how to get the ODBC driver manager on OS X to recognize it. 
I had to get back to "real" work so I never got a chance to try to 
connect to anything. The same evening, I ran across an article that 
documented all of this:

http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2003/07/25/odbc.html

Of course, no amount of googling uncovered this earlier in the day when 
I needed it :).

Let me know if you get it working.

BTW, the LWM docs say ODBC is only supported on Windows, but (require 
"odbc") loads everything without any errors. Any chance this might 
actually work on the Mac?

Best,


John DeSoi, Ph.D.

odbc works fine on Linux too. I do not have tested it yet but I can's
see why myODBC or unixODBC should not work on Mac OS X too.

I sense the pressence of a deeper Murphy-like law here :)  Of course I 
sent my email after extensive googling as well! :)

So far I installed the openliksw driver without success.  I'll try more 
next week.

I was under the impression that it would work as well.  Anyway, so far 
I still have problems with the drivers themselves.

Thanks for the pointer.


Cheers
