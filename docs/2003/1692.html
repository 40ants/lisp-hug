                <h1>Location of fasl files in defsystem?</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

Is it possible to specify in lw:defsystem where fasl files are 
written?  By default, they are just dropped in the same location as the
source files.   The documentation seems quiet on this point -- I'm rather
hoping there is some undocumented way.  Suppose I have my source files in a
directory 

devel/project1

then in paticular, I would like to specify that fasl files are written to the
directory 

devel/project1/fasl 

I realise that other defsystems allow this, but I would rather use
lw:defsystem as it integrates better with the rest of the LW environment.

Thanks,

Barry Wilkes.

At least in 4.3 when using compile-system you can use :target-directory 
to specify the location of any subsequent fasl-files.

Hope this helps!

It would be nice if defsystem took this :target-directory keyword and then
compile-system and load-system used this as the default.  Any hope?

&gt Yes, :OBJECT-PATHNAME is the option to use. We need to document this -

While I'm on the subject of defsystem, I suspect it has a protocol to extend
it to handle different file types.  If so, is there any chance this could be
documented?  Even at the level of a post to this list?

Barry.
