                <h1>Announcement: The regex coach</h1>
                <pre>OK, here's why I've been pestering the list with questions in the last
weeks: In order to learn CAPI programming I decided to write a 'real'
program (instead of just doing little examples). The idea I came up
with is an interactive regex tutor which is based on my CL-PPCRE
library. I admit this might not be very interesting for Lisp
programmers but some Perl/PHP guys I know really like it... :)

I think it is a halfway decent showcase for what you can do with
CAPI. (I haven't found any downloadable examples online except for
Wade Humeniuk's "Runner's Log".)

Although I was often bitten by the not-so-good state of the CAPI docs
I have to say that it was a real pleasure to write this little app in
my spare time. I'm pretty sure this wasn't the last program I've used
CAPI for.

Here's the URL in case you want to look at it:

  &lt;http://weitz.de/regex-coach/&gt.

Thanks in advance for constructive criticism and bug reports.

Cheers,
Edi.

Thanks Edi,

You can see the Runner's Log Manual at

http://www3.telus.net/public/whumeniu/Manual.html

complete with screenshots.  LWW 4.1 and CAPI app.  The Runner's
Log is free and has been downloaded about 3000 times so far.
