                <h1>pixmaps, images, and transparency</h1>
                <pre>
Hi,

I am building an application using LW and CAPI. This is my first in 
lisp, and so also LW.

The UI for the application requires me to draw a fairly complex diagram 
on the screen. There will be dozens, potentially hundreds of these 
things on the screen at the same time, so they will overlap. There is 
also a fairly high computational overhead to determine the layout of 
these things (not so much drawing time, but figuring out *what* to draw 
can be time consuming).

Normally there is an opaque background. We were playing around with 
dragging them around and found that there is a real usability 
improvement if we change the alpha channel to about .5 giving us a 
degree of transparency.

Out of concern for performance I am now drawing each thing to a pixmap, 
once in 'normal' rendering, once in 'drag' rendering (i.e. with a 
transparent background), then converting the pixmaps to images and 
caching the images. If the thing changes then I create a new image. 
Pretty standard I suppose.

First questions. It is quite possible that the pixmap graphics ports 
were introduced as a way of double buffering, and that the conversion 
of a pixmap to an image for cached display, like I'm doing, was a 
secondary concern.
	- Is this approach that I've taken reasonable?
	- Obviously I'm 'spending' memory to 'buy' time, what is this actually 
costing me in memory?
	- How efficient are the internal images?
	- Is there a better way to do this?

An alternative approach is to record, somehow, the drawing instructions 
rather than keeping the image around. It may well use less memory, and 
I already know that drawing won't be an issue (as I say, it is figuring 
out what to draw...), and I can avoid the next questions....

Second questions. Are transparent backgrounds supported in images? I 
don't know if I'm doing something wrong, but the image (as a whole) has 
a background exactly the same as if there was an opaque white 
background behind my transparent background. I tried setting the 
background of the pixmap (0 0 0 0) and clearing the pixmap but this 
does not appear to have any affect. I can set the background to, blue 
say, and it will affect the background colour, but the image is still 
opaque). I've also tried setting the background in the draw-image call 
to (0 0 0 0), with no visible effect at all. Is there some colour model 
stuff I need to be aware of?

Thanks,
Bob

This part, in lisp, is trivial.  You simply "record" the drawing instruction 
using a closure - #'(lambda...).  I have a drawing tool that keeps a "display 
list".  I add capi/gp things to the display list like this:

(push #'(lambda () 
    (gp:draw-rectangle pane x y w h :filled nil)) 
  display-list)

and at drawing time, the pane-display-callback contains code that simply 
funcalls each item on the display list, like this:

(dolist (func display-list)
    (funcall func))

I benchmarked this - for speed, not size - in LW - against a more traditional 
data-contained-in-a-display-list algorithm and found that the closure method, 
above, ran faster.  YMMV.

Unfortunately, I still need to know about transparency in images. Is it 
supported?

Also, what external image types are supported? I can't seem to find 
anything documented, though it seems that compressed bmp files work.

                    <pre>I've convinced myself that I'm wrong about the compressed bmp file. I 
had been tempted to write "some kind of compressed bmp file", probably 
should have. Bmp appears to be as bad as they've always been.

Hi,

The transparency responses have been helpful (and I'll be using the 
information), but I really meant alpha channel values less than 1.0 -- 
do images in LW support alpha channels?

Thanks,

&gt
&gt But bitmaps don't support alpha channels, right? So you will need some

&gt
&gt One possibility is GP:MAKE-IMAGE-FROM-PORT.

This is how I got onto all this in the first place. I was drawing to a
