                <h1>Modifying CAPI elements in multi-threaded program</h1>
                <pre>Hi!

The CAPI User Guide says that "a displayed CAPI element should only be
modified in its own thread." I'm currently writing my first "real"
CAPI application (so this may be a dumb question) and I have a
situation where I intend to start a (background) thread by pressing a
push button. I want this background thread to be able to modify a
display-pane or something similar so there's always a line somewhere
in my GUI telling me the current status of the background thread.

How am I supposed to do that without violating the rule cited above?

Thanks in advance,
Edi.

Uh, sorry, it was late yesterday. I should have heard about the
cookbook before... :)
