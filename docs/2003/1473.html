                <h1>XML parser</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

I'm new to lispworks, new to cl for that matter.

Is there an XML parser that is used with lispworks? Sorry, this has to 
be a FAQ but I can't identify one.

I was looking through the manual for the IDE and in one section the 
tools being described are shown in screen shots to be working with an 
XML package. This package supports XPATH. That makes me think that it 
might be cl-xml that is being used. Is it? If it is, how does one get a 
copy -- www.cl-xml.org is very non-responsive. I noticed that cl-http 
has a copy of cl-xml from 1999 included, but I have also noticed that 
cl-xml has been updated a number of times since then.

While I'm at it, is there an archive of this mailing list?

Thanks, and I apologise for the noise.

Bob

Works fine for me, the server is definitely up and running.

You should definitely get a current version. If you continute to have
connected-related problems you might want to contact the author
directly: &lt;james.anderson@setf.de&gt.

Yes, try gmane.org.

No problem.

Edi.
