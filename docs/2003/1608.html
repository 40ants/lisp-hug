                <h1>capi questions</h1>
                <pre>1. What is the best way to put a grid of fine lines on
a multi-column-list-panel as dividers between the rows
and between the columns?  Or as an alternative maybe
giving each field a slightly different background
color, in a checkerboard pattern.

2. Is there a hook or callback when a capi interface
is idle and ready for user input?  E.g. a
multi-column-list-panel in a tab layout does not
always give focus to the data of the
multi-column-list-panel, but I can work around that
problem by setting the focus after it completes the
output of the window and is idle waiting for input. 
There are also lots of other situations where it can
be handy to have a hook or callback at the moment a
window becomes idle and ready for user input.

3. I still have the same basic questions as before
about push buttons in Windows XP.  They basically seem
to be unable to reliably refuse focus and unable to
use :foreground and :background colors.  My main
question about them at this point is whether those are
definitely Microsoft bugs and whether there is any
easy way to work around them.  Or did I miss some
answers?  My email is not always reliable.  Is there
an archive of this forum where I can look for answers
I may have missed?
