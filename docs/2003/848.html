&gt    However, when I make it into a DLL, it exhibits the following
&gt    behavior.
&gt
&gt    I call the main function (the entry point of both the stand-alone
&gt    app and of the DLL) and the interface is brought up with no
&gt    problems.  Then I can interact with the application.  However
&gt
&gt    1 - (Minor point) The "calling application" - some C++ stuff - is
&gt    frozen in the meanwhile.
&gt
&gt Your application made a function call into lisp and is waiting for
&gt that call to return. What you probably want to do is to spawn off a
&gt new thread immediately on entry to lisp and allow the calling function
&gt to return. (Alternatively you could spawn a thread in the C++
&gt application in which call into lisp, but that looks like much more
&gt work.)
&gt

Yep.  I will just spawn a new thread.  The only problem is then to 
catch new calls from the C++ application.  I wouldn't want to respawn 
the whole interface.

&gt    2 - (Major mess) When I "exit" from the CAPI interface (close the
&gt    window) the all application is brought down (since I call a QUIT).
&gt
&gt There are two ways of generating a DLL: via save-image and using
&gt Delivery. If your case is save-image then I'm stumped, but imagine
&gt you're talking about Delivery here. The answer in this case is to set
&gt the following keyword
&gt     :quit-when-no-windows nil
&gt
&gt Let us know whether you've still got problems!

I generate the DLL using DELIVERY.  I hadn't noticed the 
:QUIT-WHEN-NO-WINDOWS keyword.  I'll try that out.  If it works then it 
will be sweet.

Cheers
