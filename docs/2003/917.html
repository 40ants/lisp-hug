                <h1>Re: COM. Questions and Bugs</h1>
                <pre>Some progress has been made.

I now have a question.

How are enums treated in the COM interface?

COM:MIDL gives out messages like

;;;   Enum Constant SCRIPTSTATE_UNINITIALIZED as 
SCRIPTSTATE_UNINITIALIZED

However, how can I use that symbol in a DEFINE-COM-METHOD?  Doing a 
FIND-SYMBOL on "SCRIPTSTATE_UNINITIALIZED" followed by a (DESCRIBE *) 
seems to indicate that the symbol has been created, but that there is 
no value associated to it.

Cheers

&gt I don't use com:midl, everything I need is a type library and I use
&gt defsystem to compile &amp; load it. So your mileage might differ.
&gt
&gt Enum constants map to defconstant. This can lead to entertaining
&gt clashes down the line. StdOle2 contains:
&gt
&gt    typedef [uuid(E6C8FA08-BD9F-11D0-985E-00C04FC29993)]
&gt    enum {
&gt        Default = 0,
&gt        Monochrome = 1,
&gt        VgaColor = 2,
&gt        Color = 4
&gt    } LoadPictureConstants;
&gt
&gt which results in a (defconstant color). But the type library I'm using
&gt contains a number of places where color is used as a parameter, for
&gt example:
&gt
&gt        HRESULT isTransparent(
&gt                        [in] long color,
&gt                        [out, retval] VARIANT_BOOL* pIsTransparent);
&gt
&gt The outcome: "Error trying to rebind a constant." How we laughed. Sigh,
&gt you probably get away with it in the C world because the reader is
&gt case sensitive. I unintern COLOR (and DEFAULT, which too has started
&gt giving me unwarranted hassle recently) from *package* and carry
&gt on. The following:
&gt
&gt     (dolist (symbol '(color default))
&gt       (let ((value (symbol-value symbol)))
&gt 	(makunbound symbol)
&gt 	(setf (symbol-value symbol) value)))
&gt

Ok.  Thanks for the warning.

&gt works well enough.
&gt
&gt    However, how can I use that symbol in a DEFINE-COM-METHOD?  Doing a
&gt    FIND-SYMBOL on "SCRIPTSTATE_UNINITIALIZED" followed by a (DESCRIBE
&gt    *) seems to indicate that the symbol has been created, but that
&gt    there is no value associated to it.
&gt
&gt I'll pass on that.
&gt

Any other taker?

This is now the show stopper for me.  And it is not just a show stopper 
for me or Lispworks.  It is a show stopper for Common Lisp in my lab 
(don't ask why).

Cheers

So, shall I conclude that you cannot use enum constants in the 
COM/AUTOMATION interface?

Shall I pack my Common Lisp and throw it out of the window?
