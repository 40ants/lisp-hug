                <h1>RE: default indents</h1>
                <pre>I've seen this happen before LispWorks has expanded a new macro. In other
words, if I write a new macro, then use it somewhere, I'll get the
indentation you describe. However, if I write a new macro, compile it,
*then* use it somewhere, indentation is as expected.

Subject: default indents


I'm stumped as to why the default indentation of macros is arbitrarily 
different. For example:

(let-connection ()
   (test 1234))

(let-connection2 ()
                  (test 134))


I can fix let-connection2 by adding an entry in my init file for 
editor:setup-indent, but I hate to do that every time I create a macro. 
Is there some way to globally specify this?

Thanks,

John DeSoi, Ph.D.

Yes, that was it -- indents differently if the macro is evaluated 
versus compiled.

Which brings up the next question. I sometimes evaluate things because 
I find it distracting that compiling always switches to the Output tab. 
Unless there is an error or warning, evaluating stays in on in the Text 
view and puts a "Finished Evaluating" message at the bottom of the 
window. Is there a way to make compiling work the same way - only 
switch to Output if there is an error or warning?

Thanks,
