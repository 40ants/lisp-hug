I think this is not supported but here's and old message from the

&gt Under Windws 2000, LWW 4.2, the wheel on my microsoft mouse does not
&gt work.  I can live without it, but if anybody knows how to enable it,
&gt I'd be interested.

This is not ideal, but here's something the Xanalys support team told
me about a year or so ago:

There's a thing called MouseWheel available at
http://www.microsoft.com/msj/defaultframe.asp?page=/msj/0697/hood0697.htm&amp;nav=/msj/0697/newnav.htm

The file you want is called Hood0697.exe.

It works by intercepting the wheel messages and turning them into
scroll messages.

You have to tell it about every application for which you want it to
intercept the wheel messages, so if you are producing delivered
applications from LW, you need to tell MouseWheel about those as well
as telling it about LW itself. If you are passing on delivered apps
to other people, those people will need MouseWheel too.

To make MouseWheel start automatically at startup, add a shortcut to
mw.exe in your ...\Start Menu\Programs\Startup folder.

It would be much nicer if LW itself handled the wheel messages --
perhaps Xanalys could add that to the Wish List for the next release
or the one after?
