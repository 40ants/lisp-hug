                <h1>LispWorks on Mandrake Linux</h1>
                <pre>Hello,

I have installed Mandrake linux 9.0 on my pc and since I get the
following error when I attempt to run LispWorks (professional):

$ /usr/local/lib/LispWorks/lispworks-4200
 
Error: FIND-NAMED-WIN32-PROC-INDIRECT "errno" (unicode switch :NO)
 
Type :b for backtrace, :c &lt;option number&gt to proceed,  or :? for
other options
 
CL-USER 1 : 1 &gt Segmentation fault

I removed Lispworks rpm and re-installed it from the CD but the problem
remains.

Any suggestion is much appreciated.

Thanks,

Thibault Langlois

This seems to have happened before (google):

http://lists.debian.org/debian-glibc/2002/debian-glibc-200212/msg00369.html

I am not sure what they are talking about there but it looks like you
have to up- or downgrade your glibc.

&gt 
&gt Yes, it's definitely a glibc problem that the Debian glibc guys
&gt patched. I'm not sure where that patch is relative to the upstream
&gt glibc.
&gt 

Thanks to Nils and Kevin, I'll try to upgrade glibc.

&gt BTW, if you really want to do lisp on Linux, I strongly encourage you
&gt to check out Debian. There are nearly 100 Common Lisp packages in the
&gt sarge and sid distributions which all transparently compile and load
&gt using Debian's Common Lisp Controller.
&gt 

I heard lot of people praise Debian linux. I will try it some day on my
home computer but in the particular case the computer is my employer's
and I did not have the choice of the distribution. 

&gt For example, to install clsql-mysql (and transparent also install
&gt uffi), you'd give the command
&gt   apt-get install cl-sql-mysql
&gt 
&gt Then, in Lispworks, you'd just give the command
&gt   (require 'clsql-mysql)
&gt to have uffi and clsql automatically compiled (if necessary) and
&gt loaded.
&gt 
&gt Common Lisp Controller supports lispworks, allegro, sbcl, cmucl, and
&gt clisp.
