                <h1>Tiny example apps</h1>
                <pre>Hi everyone,

I wonder if anybody could give me some links to example code, maybe from 
some more experienced users. I'm right now a bit stuck and would just 
like to see some successful examples to get a clue.

If it doesn't have to be LW-specific I'd suggest looking at CLiki. It
lists tons of interesting Common Lisp programs which are "open
source", i.e. the source code is available for download. CLiki is at

  &lt;http://www.cliki.net/&gt

in case you didn't know already.

Cheers,
Edi.

Just to be sure: Are you aware of the capi example code that comes 
with lispworks? It certainly helped me get started.

Since my PrimeTrader application was mentioned later in the thread:
Yes, it's 100% LispWorks with CAPI. We don't give away the source
code, though (we're open to the idea, though, and may eventually
open-source at least part of it). Also, some of the code is not
suitable for beginners (e.g. the table panes may look like
grid-layouts, but they're really pinboard layouts with the cells being
drawn-pinboard-objects, so some of the stuff is done at a lower level
than you usually want to do when starting with capi).
