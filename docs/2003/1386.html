&gt LispWorks does not support this. Why not do:
&gt 
&gt (require 'foo "/predefined/directory/foo")
&gt 

For the same reason that LispWorks doesn't do it that way: to abstract 
away the location of modules. Given that it already exists and is used, 
why not go ahead and support it?

But REQUIRE is evil, isn't it?

Hmm. Maybe I should try to make my simple little SMART-REQUIRE 
publicly available.

Note that logical pathnames can abstract the position of modules
away.  Even without the REQUIRE-MODULE I described just now, you can
do:

   (require :com.cley.weld "CLEY-LIB:COM;CLEY;WELD;WELD-LOADER")

(or whatever convention you want) which just leaves you to define the
logical host appropriately.  In fact to first order REQUIRE-MODULE
just destructures the module name in the obvious backwards-domain-name
way and then uses it to construct a sequence of appropriate (generally
logical) pathnames.

We have a structured version of REQUIRE, whereby you say something
like:

(require-module :com.cley.weld)

And it will do some fairly smart (and configurable via a fairly hardy
search spec) searching, looking for things like
CLEY-LIB:COM;CLEY;WELD;WELD-LOADER and various other things.  When it
finds something it loads it and expects it to do a PROVIDE somewhere
along the line (typically the loader file loads a sysdcl and then
loads the system - there is actually some (hacky) support for
`forgetting' system definitions).

Apart from the forgetting-system stuff it it probably portable CL.  I
could make it available (but not now) if anyone is interested.
Actually, it's possible that it *is* available if you look in my lisp
hax stuff, I forget if that was part of the LW-specific things.

MK:DEFSYSTEM as a standard entry point

	ADD-REGISTRY-LOCATION &lt;pathname&gt

which you can stick in your .lispwork init file.

MK:LOAD-SYSTEM and MK:COMPILE-SYSTEM will look in the directories 
listed in MK:*CENTRAL-REGISTRY* for system definition files.

That is to say,

	(mk:compile-system "foo")

Will look for a file named "foo.system" in all the directories listed 
in MK:*CENTRAL-REGISTRY*.  Hopefully, the file will contain a system 
definition form for system "foo".

MK:*CENTRAL-REGISTRY* will always contain the current directory.

Cheers

Marco

I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for but here are two old
threads which might be helpful:
