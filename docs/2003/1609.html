                <h1>CAPI, LISP and "functional programming"</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

I've been getting the hang now of some of the capi stuff. I now at least 
manage to display a calendar, forward months, years and select days. Not 
much sofar I know, but I'm glad I've gotten this far.

But, somehow I feel that I'm going the wrong way. I'm still pretty new 
to GUI (and therefore CAPI) and also CL. First of all It takes me an 
awfully lot of code to set state changes, for the GUI allone, i.e. 
resetting values in this place and that place and for redisplaying, 
basically all by hand. I've been using a lot of SETFs and I feel I 
shouldn't.

What I mean is my code doesn't look very "functionl" but rather very 
much well "imperative". I really don't see the light yet, and I have the 
feeling that the CAPI or rather CLOS and "functional programming" 
exclude each other.

I mean is that just the way it is or have a missed a point?

Guenther

Well CLOS deals with Objects and you can see Objects as "history of
frozen state". So how comes FP into play? First you can use all the
mapping functions to change states. And second you program logic can
be "full functional" programmes. The questions still remains, is that
really what you want? What's wrong with using state in some area and
getting along in other areas. 

Just an example that you need "side-effects" can be seen in the
gtk-ghc stuff! This is an Hello World written in it:
module Main (Main.main) where

import Gtk

-- If you return False in the "delete_event" signal handler, GTK will
-- emit the "destroy" signal.  



deleteEvent :: Event -&gt IO Bool
                         ^^^^^^ This is a monadict Bool. Monads are
Hasekells way to deal with State


deleteEvent _ = do 
  putStrLn "delete event" 
  -- Returning True means you don't want the window to be destroyed.
  -- This is useful for popping up 'are you sure you want to quit?' type dialogs.
  return False

-- Another callback
destroyEvent :: IO ()
destroyEvent = do
  putStrLn "destroy event"
  mainQuit

main :: IO ()
main = do
  initGUI
  -- Create a new window
  window &lt;- windowNew
        ^^^^ this is a "sort of assignment"
  -- When the window is given the "delete_event" signal (this is given 
  -- by the window manager, usually by the "close" option, or on the
  -- titlebar), we ask it to call the deleteEvent function defined above.
  onDelete window deleteEvent
  -- Here we connect the "destroy" event to a signal handler.
  -- This event occurs when we call widgetDestroy on the window,
  -- or if we return FALSE in the "delete_event" callback.
  onDestroy window destroyEvent
  -- Sets the border width of the window.
  containerSetBorderWidth window 10
  -- Creates a new button with the label "Hello World".
  buttonHW &lt;- buttonNewWithLabel "Hello World"
           ^^^^^ again a sort of assignment
  -- When the button receives the "clicked" signal, it will call the
  -- function given as the second argument
  onClicked buttonHW (putStr "Hello World\n")
  -- This will cause the window to be destroyed by calling
  -- widgetDestroy when "clicked".  Again, the destroy
  -- signal could come from here, or the window manager.
  onClicked buttonHW $ do
    putStrLn "A \"clicked\"-handler to say \"destroy\""
    widgetDestroy window
  containerAdd window buttonHW
  -- This packs the button into the window (a gtk container).
  widgetShow buttonHW
  -- The final step is to display this newly created widget
  widgetShow window
  -- and the window
  -- All GTK applications must have a Gtk.main. Control ends here
  -- and waits for an event to occur (like a key press or
  -- mouse event).
  mainGUI 
  putStrLn "runLoop returned"

So this program written in a "pure" functional programming language
does deal with state! 

So I don't think you missed something, you should accept that CAPI is
an OO-Framework, and therefor dealing with state is "natural"

Did you come from Scheme to Common Lisp? It's important to understand
that CL is "multi paradigm" and not "functional". And the GUI part of
a GUI-oriented program typically involves a lot of OO and SETF stuff.
A quick glance through the program I'm working on right now, shows
me that the GUI-part is mostly imperative and OO in its style, but
the interface from the GUI to the "real stuff" involves some functions
that are more oriented towards a functional style (mapping etc.).
