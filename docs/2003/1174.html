                <h1>capi and cursor interface</h1>
                <pre>Hola,

I'm a new capi and looking for some wisdom about the feasibility of a 
database interface. In particular, I'm interested in creating a 
database cursor interface for browsing what could possibly be many 
thousands of records (with resizable and configurable columns). I just 
want to dynamically load just enough data to fill the display, but have 
the scroll bars correspond to the number of rows in the cursor and use 
scrolling for browsing.

Would a grid layout be able to handle something like this, or would I 
need to create a custom pane type? Any pointers to examples where 
something like this has already been done?

Thanks,

John DeSoi, Ph.D.

I'm not sure but maybe this one is close to what you want:

  (see Ystok-Grid)

Cheers,

Thanks for the pointer. This looks pretty impressive, but so far I 
can't use it directly. It makes use of an internal capi class called 
capi::header-control which is not in the 4.3 Mac version. I could not 
find anything equivalent.

I'm going to start with capi:multi-column-list-panel as Wade Humeniuk 
suggested.

Best,

                 <pre>You probably are looking for a

capi:multi-column-list-panel

Its currently undocumented.

Here is an example withinn an actual db driven interface.

(capi:define-interface merchants-customer-admin-panel ()
  ((merchant-id :initform nil))
  (:panes
   (admins capi:multi-column-list-panel

                      (:title first-name :align :left)
                      (:title email :align :left)
                      (:title "Activate Offers?" :align :left))

Hi Wade,

Yes, I missed multi-column-list-panel.

Thanks very much for the example!
