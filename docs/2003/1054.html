                <h1>KW objects</h1>
                <pre>
Hi all,

I've been working with kw-objects and I've got a little problem. I have 
an object of a given class that contains some instance variables with 
list with other objects (these are the kw-objects). The idea is to send 
only 1 object to file for "saving an image" of my program. When I load 
this "image" I can see the first object and inspect its instance 
variables to look at the other objects. Nevertheless, when I query for 
objects in the kw-listener (or in the objects inspector) I get no 
result. I mean, the objects exist (because I can see them by inspecting 
the "root" object I've saved) but I cannot see them when querying with 
kw! anyone has an idea of what's happening?

thanks,
Miro Casanova

You have to explain how you save and load your objects. KW's internal
RETE network needs to be told about KW objects. Usually it notices
them by watching MAKE-INSTANCE (I think) so maybe you are loading them
in some other way?
