                <h1>Buttons with images</h1>
                <pre>I seem to be too dense to create buttons with images. The entry for
the BUTTON class in the CAPI reference manual refers to the CAPI user
guide where I should find more about generic images. I find nothing
about generic images there. Hmm...

So I tried to do it with MAKE-LOAD-FORM like it is in done in
buttons.lisp in the examples folder but I only succeeded with the
enabled image and I think this was pure luck.

I managed to create create a DIB file with a small orange arrow
surrounded by white and converted it as explained above. Now I have a
grey button with an orange arrow on it - fine. The fact that the white
pixels "disappear", i.e. are replaced with the button's own color,
seems to be dependent on the TRANSPARENT-COLOR-INDEX slot of the
EXTERNAL-IMAGE. Needless to say this slot isn't explained in the GP
reference entry for EXTERNAL-IMAGE.

What I found out by experimenting is that the enabled image looks like
it should if I set the TRANSPARENT-COLOR-INDEX to 1. If I set it to 0
I get a grey arrow instead. Hmm...

The disabled image doesn't work at all. Most of the time I just get
grey squares. I guess (but I may be totally wrong) that the disabled
image isn't just displayed but somehow overlayed on top of the enabled
image.

Anybody out there who can help?

Thanks,
Edi.

                 <h1>Re: Buttons with images</h1>
                 <pre>There is an example of imaged buttons in the opengl code that comes with LW.  

Its in :

&lt;some xanalys installation prefix&gt/examples/opengl/examples/icosahedron.lisp
and arrows.lisp.  Enabled and disabled images in a ico-button-panel.
