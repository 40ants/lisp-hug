                <h1>Tuning the GC for lots of ephemeral objects</h1>
                <pre>Greetings. We'd like to use a particular Lisp library with our app that
offers some nice connectivity between Lisp and Java. However, after
conducting some performance measurements it appears to me that this library
generates a large amount of ephemeral objects; the result is, after a bit of
run time our app begins to slow down siginificantly, apparently due to
garbage collection. I'm fairly confident in this analysis because we're
simply supplying the app with the same small data set over and over, from a
Java client. Initially, the Lisp app moves along nicely. Then, as mentioned
it begins to slow down. The same data set provided via a different input
interface, but still from a Java client, does not exhibit this behavior and
the image size grows substantially more slowly.

Assuming the library isn't leaking, is it possible to tune the LW GC for
very large amounts of ephemeral (generation 0) objects? If so, how best
would I go about it? Thanks much...
