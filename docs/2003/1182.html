                <h1>ARRAY-TOTAL-SIZE-LIMIT</h1>
                <pre>.... is relatively small.

Are there plans to crank it up somehow?

Cheers

Sure. I had some problem with it some time ago...

Yes! Please do it!

The current 17" Powerbook has something like 1440x900 (which is not
that high a resolution, but readable and without ghost effects ;-) ).
Since you have a DVI connector, you can attach large LCD screens
like the 1920x1200 23" Cinema display.

Or you can wait for a G5 Powerbook with a 64bit Lisp - where
the ARRAY-TOTAL-SIZE-LIMIT could be quite a bit larger. ;-)

I have "only" a 15" G4 Powerbook and a 22" Cinema display, but it
works nicely with LispWorks for Macintosh. Still, rumors
have it that the Powerbook line will be updated soon.
The next MacWorld conference is only a few days away.

Actually I'm ***quite*** impressed with LispWorks for Macintosh.
Xanalys did a very good job porting LispWorks. It is
really fun to use.
