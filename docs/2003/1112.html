Works fine with LW when used together with acl-compat. You can apt-get
it directly if you use Debian or - if you're on another platform - you
can download the Debian packages and see how they've done it.

I had some GC issues with many very large emails (5MB and larger) when
using IMAP but this was easy to work around.

HTH,
Edi.

You can find code for ACL on opensource.franz.com. It should be fairly
trivial to port to LW. Get the IF* macro from acl-compat and change
the names of the socket functions.
