                <h1>How to send EOF to SYS:OPEN-PIPE?</h1>
                <pre>How can I use SYS:OPEN-PIPE with programs that read until EOF,
i.e. how can I signal that I'm finished sending data to a program? The
example from the docs doesn't work in this case:

(with-open-stream
  (s (sys:open-pipe "perl -lne '$count++; END {print $count}'"
                    :direction :io))
  (write-line "foo" s)
  (write-line "bar" s)
  (force-output s)
  (read-line s))

I want this to return "2" but it hangs instead.

Thanks,
Edi.

If you run the line of perl by itself in bash, you find that it does not 
finish until you hit ^D (unix eof character).

The lisp code and the perl code are hanging, waiting for each other to send 
EOF.

This is a protocol problem.

You either need to open two separate streams - one output, one input - and 
close the output pipe before reading from the input, or, you need to rewrite 
the perl scriptlet so that it runs a simple protocol and "knows" when to quit 
(e.g. it quits when lisp sends it some specific character).

pt

p.s. After a quick glance at the manuals, I don't see how to open two streams 
on one shell command, so I would suggest altering the perl.

Altering the program is not an option, unfortunately. (It's a C
program and I don't have the source. I used the Perl snippet for
illustration purposes only.)

I had hopes that LW would allow for separate streams like CMUCL or
AllegroCL but it looks like this isn't possible. In CMUCL you can, for
example, do it like this:

  (let (prog)
    (unwind-protect
      (progn
        (setq prog
                (ext:run-program "/tmp/foo.pl" nil
                                 :output :stream
                                 :input :stream
                                 :wait nil))
        (with-open-stream (in (ext:process-input prog))
          (write-line "foo" in)
          (write-line "bar" in)
          (write-line "baz" in))
        (with-open-stream (out (ext:process-output prog))
          (with-output-to-string (s)
            (loop for line = (read-line out nil nil)
                  while line
                  do (write-string line s)))))
      (ext:process-close prog)))

("foo.pl" is a small Perl script which counts the lines coming from
stdin. This form will actually return the string "3".)

This doesn't work in CMUCL, BTW, if I replace "foo.pl" with the Perl
one-liner from my previous post but this doesn't bother me. I guess
you have to use the :PTY variant of RUN-PROGRAM in this case.

Thanks,
Edi.

&gt Pending a reply from David Fox, have you tried the following kludges?:
&gt 
&gt a) if you only need the final reply from the C program, then use an
&gt input stream and redirect the output of the C program to a file
&gt (sys:with-open-pipe "cprog &gt/tmp/reply" :direction :output)
&gt 
&gt b) Write a small C / Perl / whatever program that invokes the big C
&gt program, redirecting stdin and stdout to two separate file
&gt descriptors.  The tiny program can run a small protocol with the
&gt lisp program.
&gt 
&gt c) You could probably do it all with FFI and direct calls to Unix
&gt exec, read and write.
&gt 
&gt d) Use two comm:socket-stream's in lisp.  Write two perl (C / Tcl/Tk
&gt / whatever) helpers - one which reads from a socket and writes to
&gt stdout, the other reads from stdin and writes to a socket, then do
&gt something like
&gt 
&gt 	(sys:run-shell-command "sock2stdout | cprog | stdin2sock")

Thanks for the helpful ideas! I'll try some of these unless someone
comes up with a LW feature I don't know of yet.

Thanks again,
Edi.
