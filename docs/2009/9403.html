                <h1>How to access database on a server from Lispworks on desktop</h1>
                <pre>
I have a server with django and postgres and I would like to access the 
database from LWW on my desktop. I have a few ideas for what the pieces 
might be but not sure how they go together or if they are the best 
pieces.  Maybe Lispworks can send JSON requests to the server?  Maybe 
that would use CL-JSON? What is the mechanism by which Lispworks 
actually communicates with the server? Thanks for any help.

Mitch

There are plenty of libraries that can talk to Postgres directly. For  
example:

Postmodern (http://common-lisp.net/project/postmodern/)

CLSQL (http://clsql.b9.com/)
