                <h1>Aligning text-input-panes</h1>
                <pre>
Is there some trick to getting a column of text-input-panes (and their  
titles) to align neatly?

An example of what I want would be a form for entering people's names,  
addresses and phone numbers, with a right-justified column of labels  
(such as "Name,"  "Address," "City," "Phone") properly aligned with  
their respective input rectangles, which would all start at the same  
horizontal position.

I don't see a way to do this with text-input-panes alone (short of  
padding titles with spaces and using a non-proportional font).

I've tried using a grid-layout with :has-title-column-p set to t. That  
at least aligns the input rectangles, but I'm not finding a way to  
right-justify the labels.

I've also encountered a related problem. When I do something like this:

(capi:contain (make-instance 'capi:text-input-pane :title  
"Temperature" :title-position :left :title-adjust :right))

"Temperature" goes to the bottom of the pane.

Is there an easy solution I'm missing, or is it time that I started to  
use pinboard-layouts?

Thanks!

How do you wait to execute a line of code in lisp? I want to just pause execute to observe something.
Thanks

&gt&gt Actually, now that I've widened the window, the edit rectangles do
&gt&gt line up, and so do the titles - horizontally. But the titles are
&gt&gt still aligned flush with the bottoms of the rectangles (a little
&gt&gt lower than that, in fact), instead of being vertically centered.

&gt For a grid-layout with two columns I use:
&gt
&gt :x-adjust '(:right :left)
&gt :y-adjust :center
&gt
&gt And then just create labels in the first column (you can use strings
&gt directly without any object) and the control in the second column
&gt (with no title).
