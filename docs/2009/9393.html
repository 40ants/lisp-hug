                <h1>SnowLeopard - Code signing of delivered applications.</h1>
                <pre>
I don't have a beta of Apple's SnowLeopard OS, but was wondering if 
there are going to be any issues with code-signing and delivered 
LispWorks applications?



My understanding of this may be faulty, so correct me if I am mistaken.

Assumption 1:   I understand  that all apps on SnowLeopard have to be 
signed. 

Assumption 2:  The signing mechanism as it exists now on Leopard breaks 
any delivered LispWorks applications, making them inoperable.

Assumption 3: The system of signing applications on SnowLeopard will 
probably not change much from the way it is on Leopard.

Ergo:  Applications delivered from LispWorks will not deployable on 
SnowLeopard.


I hope one or more of my assumptions are wrong.  Anyone know which?  Or 
is there to be LW update that will address this?

Thanks,

Chris

I'm also interested in this, and more generally (and I assume that
those under NDA who know can answer today, since it's now released?)
I'd like to know whether LispWorks itself runs, whether there are any
problems running it under Rosetta (for building fat 32 bit binaries),
and whether fat binaries produced will run fine on older OS versions
on both intel and ppc.
