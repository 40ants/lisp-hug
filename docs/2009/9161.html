                <h1>Using macro to define macros and functions in the current package?</h1>
                <pre>
I have been experimenting with macros, packages and symbols, and it
seems there may be something I do not quite understand.

Let's say I have a packages :util and :zip. :util is utilities
package, which has a macro-defining macro foo, which I call from
package :zip. I would expect that the calls interns the symbols to
package :zip but it seems it interns them into :util.

In the example below I would expect to see symbols ZIP::BAR and ZIP::Y
in the macroexpansion, not UTIL::BAR and UTIL::Y. Can somebody explain
why this is so? Is there a way to prevent this?

CL-USER 61 : 1 &gt (defpackage :util (:use :common-lisp))
#&lt;The UTIL package, 0/16 internal, 0/16 external&gt

NAPLES 62 : 1 &gt (in-package :util)
#&lt;The UTIL package, 0/16 internal, 0/16 external&gt

UTIL 63 : 1 &gt (defmacro foo ()
  `(defun bar (y)
      (format t "y=~A~%" y)))
FOO

UTIL 64 : 1 &gt (defpackage :zip (:use :common-lisp))
#&lt;The ZIP package, 0/16 internal, 0/16 external&gt

UTIL 65 : 1 &gt (in-package :zip)
#&lt;The ZIP package, 0/16 internal, 0/16 external&gt

ZIP 66 : 1 &gt (pprint (macroexpand-1 '(util::foo)))

(DEFUN UTIL::BAR (UTIL::Y) (FORMAT T "y=~A~%" UTIL::Y))

Best regards,

Mikko

Calling UTIL::FOO in your example doesn't actually intern any new
symbols.  The symbols are interned when they're read, which happens
only once, when you define the macro FOO, in package UTIL.  When you
invoke FOO, it macro-expands into (in this case) a constant list with
already-interned symbols in it.

&gt 
&gt NAPLES 62 : 1 &gt (in-package :util)
&gt #&lt;The UTIL package, 0/16 internal, 0/16 external&gt
&gt 
&gt UTIL 63 : 1 &gt (defmacro foo ()
&gt   `(defun bar (y)
&gt       (format t "y=~A~%" y)))
&gt FOO

This is similar to

  (in-package :util)

  (defmacro foo ()
    (make-foo-definition))

  (defun make-foo-definition ()
    '(defun bar (y)
	(format t "y=~A~%" y)))

You wouldn't expect calling MAKE-FOO-DEFINITION to return symbols in
any package but UTIL, would you?  So macro-expanding FOO necessarily
returns a list with symbols in UTIL.

Hope that helps.

Both excellent answers, thank you. It seems so obvious now...

So to answer my own question, the basic idea how to define functions
in package of macro call is:

(defmacro foo ()
  `(defun ,(intern "BAR") ()))

&gt
&gt As for "Is there a way to prevent this?" consider
&gt
&gt &nbsp;(DEFSTRUCT FOO A B)
&gt
&gt It constructs and INTERNs names like FOO-A, FOO-B and MAKE-FOO when the
&gt DEFSTRUCT call is expanded, so they go into the package in effect at the
&gt macro call.
