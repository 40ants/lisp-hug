                <h1>Mac application icons</h1>
                <pre>
Greetings, LispWorkers.

Here's a question I'm sure someone out there can answer:

What does it take to get my own application icon on a delivered application on Mac OS X? (LWM Professional, current version, on OS X v. 10.6.2.)

Months ago I successfully delivered an application (is this supposed to sound like childbirth - and be equally difficult?). I tried to dig through some layers of code to figure out how LispWorks was giving my application its LW icon, but I gave up. Again, this was months ago; so I can't tell you exactly where I was looking, but I remember it was a pain.

Since this is a project for my own business and my employees generally know me as LW, this hasn't been a big issue. Soon though I'll have more than one application and may go commercial on one of them; so I want the fatherhood of my delivered applications to be more explicit.

By the way, this is a task that other development environments make obvious. LispWorks could be a more approachable product in this way.

As always, thank you for your assistance.

If you are using write-macos-application-bundle to create your bundle, there is a keyword, :application-icns that takes a path to a icon file, and will copy that icon into your application.
