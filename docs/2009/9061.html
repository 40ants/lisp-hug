                <h1>compiler error involving #+ and an undefined reader macro, #_</h1>
                <pre>
Trying to compile the local-time library, available at
common-lisp.net.  It has this function definition, which gets an error
at the #_gettimeofday:

  (defun %unix-gettimeofday ()
    "Cross-implementation gettimeofday abstraction"
    #+cmu
    (unix:unix-gettimeofday)
    #+sbcl
    (sb-unix:unix-gettimeofday)
    #+ccl
    (ccl::rlet ((tv :timeval))
      (#_gettimeofday tv (ccl::%null-ptr)) ;; &lt;=== ERROR on #_
      (values t (ccl::pref tv :timeval.tv_sec) (ccl::pref tv :timeval.tv_usec)))
    #-(or cmu sbcl ccl)
    (values t (get-universal-time) 0))

:ccl is not in *FEATURES*.

I got around it by 

  #-ccl
  (set-dispatch-macro-character #\# #\_ (constantly nil))

which seems to work.  (On the other hand, I'm not terribly familiar
with reader macros, so this may've been, uh, sub-optimal.  :)

My question is, why does LW try to process the reader macro at all,
since it's protected (if that's the right word) by #+ccl?

&gt       ;; Make %unix-gettimeofday compile under Lispworks, which doesn't ignore the

On CCL, #_ presumably has an equivalent non-read syntax. I think the
upstream package should just use that.

&gt I don't understand what you mean.  Do you want the LOCAL-TIME library
&gt to copy CCL's #_ read macro for every other implementation?  That
&gt would be both non-trivial and pointless.  (See
&gt http://ccl.clozure.com/ccl-documentation.html#The-Interface-Database).

No I mean instead of using the syntax it should use whatever the syntax
expands to. E.g. instead of 'foo it should use (QUOTE FOO). From
glancing at the documentation, (#_foo ...) is equivalent to
(EXTERNAL-CALL "foo" ...)  or something similiar.

&gt&gt Since (in LW) reader macros are called even in a #+/#-, the issue

&gt Well, everyone who doesn't already have a reader macro defined which
&gt does something different.  Read macros are horribly global things.

Actually they're not so horrible. Not more than packages that
is.[*] 

What makes them horrible is that readtables are too opaque.

See http://common-lisp.net/~trittweiler/with-readtable-iterator.pdf for
a start. (I've got to fundamentally revise it before publishing which I
haven't done due to lack of time.)
