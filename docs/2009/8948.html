                <h1>safearray api calls and .Net problems</h1>
                <pre>
I've recently been updating a LispWorks DLL from LispWorks 4.1.20 (don't 
ask) to LispWorks 5.1.2
Another aspect of the change is the old DLL was called from a VB6 front 
end whereas the new version is being called from a VB.Net front end.

I've hit a really strange problem that has completely stymied me, and I 
was hoping that someone here has some experience in the same area.

The DLL passes arrays of floats back to the VB environment as an 
argument to a callback routine.  The array is manually marshaled as a 
SAFEARRAY created with a call to SafeArrayCreateVector with an element 
type of VT_R8, and the data is populated by calling SafeArrayAccessData 
and writing via the returned pointer.

The data is transferred and read by the VB routine OK.

In the .Net environment, after calling the routine between 3-6 times the 
..Net runtime flags an allocation exception and says that memory may be 
corrupt.
If I change the element type to RT4 and change the related code 
accordingly I can call the routine a larger number of times without 
error, but then as soon as the Vb.Net code makes a call to GetFileTitleA 
I get the same memory error from the .Net runtime.

If I change the Lisp side to never free (SafeArrayDestroy) the safearray 
then I don't get any errors.

I get the same problems in both the LispWorks 4.1.20 and 5.1.2 
environments (LW4 only tested with the original dll against the .net 
front end, i.e. only VT_RT8 and haven't seen if the problem disappears 
when memory not freed).

Two other interesting things - Safearrays of floats are only passed in 
one part of the code, whereas the more heavily used safearrays of BSTR 
is not giving any problems.  The other difference is that the BSTR 
safearrays are received ByVal, whereas the VT_R8 safearrays are 
(required to be?) received ByRef.
I only noticed today that even the 4.1.20 version had problems at one 
stage where a stack fault in kernel32.dll would be signalled, and this 
was avoided by a similarly ugly hack of making a single call to allocate 
a single small safearray of floats at startup that is never freed.

Any insights or suggestions gratefully received - although not freeing 
the safearrays "works", I'd rather not have to rely on that as the final 
workaround/fix.

Do you have some small sample, with which you can reproduce the problem?

I've written an ActiveX component in C++ with ATL, which sends events to
event sinks and it works with VB.NET and VB6 programs. I've mixed it with
std::string for easier interfacing with the rest of my program and it is
integrated in some other C++ classes, but the interesting part for you looks
like this:

SAFEARRAY* createSafearray(string data)
{
	METHOD_DEBUG;
	SAFEARRAYBOUND aDim[1];
	aDim[0].lLbound = 0;
	aDim[0].cElements = (ULONG) data.size();
	char *pActualData = NULL;
	SAFEARRAY* pSA = SafeArrayCreate(VT_UI1, 1, aDim);
	if (pSA == NULL) return NULL;  // out of memory
	if (SafeArrayAccessData(pSA, (void **)&amp;pActualData)) return NULL;
// can't lock
	for (int j = 0; j &lt; (int) data.size(); j++) pActualData[j] =
data[j];
	if (SafeArrayUnaccessData(pSA)) return NULL;  // can't unlock
	return pSA;
}

Void someFunction(string foo, string data)
{
	SAFEARRAY* pSA = createSafearray(data);
	if (pSA) {
		_bstr_t bar(foo.c_str());
		Fire_OnFooEvent(bar, &amp;pSA);
		SafeArrayDestroy(pSA);
	}
}

HRESULT Fire_OnFooEvent (BSTR bar, SAFEARRAY** data)
{
	HRESULT hr = S_OK;
	T * pThis = static_cast&lt;T *&gt(this);
	int cConnections = m_vec.GetSize();
	for (int iConnection = 0; iConnection &lt; cConnections; iConnection++)
	{
		pThis-&gtLock();
		CComPtr&lt;IUnknown&gt punkConnection = m_vec.GetAt(iConnection);
		pThis-&gtUnlock();

		IDispatch * pConnection = static_cast&lt;IDispatch
*&gt(punkConnection.p);

		if (pConnection)
		{
			CComVariant avarParams[2];
			avarParams[1] = bar;
			avarParams[1].vt = VT_BSTR;
			avarParams[0].pparray = data;
			avarParams[0].vt = VT_ARRAY | VT_UI1 | VT_BYREF;
			CComVariant varResult;

			DISPPARAMS params = { avarParams, NULL, 2, 0 };
			hr = pConnection-&gtInvoke(1, IID_NULL,
LOCALE_USER_DEFAULT, DISPATCH_METHOD, &amp;params, &amp;varResult, NULL, NULL);
		}
	}
	return hr;
}

The Fire_OnFooEvent was generated by the wizard from the IDL specification.
The data parameter was specified as "[in] SAFEARRAY(BYTE)* message", but the
brain damaged Visual Studio wizard creates non-compilable code from it, so I
had to search some time and read a lot to find the right way how to
implement SAFEARRAY callback parameters.

Regarding your problem: Specifying VT_BYREF should work, because then the
ownership of the object won't be transferred to the receiver, and you have
to free the object. Same with BSTR, but in this case even if you pass it by
value: the ownership is not transferred to the called function. In my code
this is handled by the smart pointer class _bstr_t (part of Visual Studio
comutil), which creates the OLECHAR object, passes a OLECHAR object to the
OnFooEvent (I think it does this with the function "operator wchar_t*()
const throw();") and destroys it automaticly after leaving the stack
context. 

All this wizards and C++ code generation are a mess compared to some nice
Lisp macros. I don't know the LispWorks COM infrastructure, but maybe
someone wants to encode all the COM rules to some simple to use macros,
which automates marshalling, object life time etc.? It should be possible,
because if you write a COM component within VB.NET, you don't have to do all
the low level details yourself. And unlike in Common Lisp, where you have to
write anything in clear to read and understandable code, operator
overloading for typedefed variables in C++ is evil :-)

&gt
&gtWhen using ByRef, maybe a different array is "returned" in the reference, even
&gtfor IN parameters?  To be safe, make sure you are freeing the safearray in the
&gtreference on return, not the one you allocated.
&gt

Thank you to Martin and Frank for the replies.

It would appear, after minimal testing, that the .Net runtime is indeed 
setting the pointer argument to a new data structure, and so far freeing 
that (rather than the SAFEARRAY allocated in LispWorks) doesn't give me 
any problems.

&gtIf you don't mind my asking, Guy.  Are you using Edi Weitz's RDNZL
&gtpackage for your .NET machinations?
&gt
&gtBrian C.
&gt

No I'm not.
The VB6&lt;-&gtLispWorks interface we wrote dates back many years and we
simply carried over the interfaces to the .Net migration of the VB6 code
using the .Net unmanaged code marshaling interfaces.

I've not looked at RDNZL, in part because using open source s/w at the
company I'm contracted too requires going through certain hoops that I
didn't fancy jumping through and possibly didn't have the time too
either.
