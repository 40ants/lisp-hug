                <pre>
Hello all,

Back in February of 2005 I had a situation where it would have been
very handy to be able to close just one side of a bidirectional stream
that was created by sys:open-pipe.  It didn't seem possible then,
though Edi Weitz had a handy little workaround.  It's now 4 and a half
years later —&nbsp;has any progress been made on this front?

It's roughly the same situation; I have a process that wants to have
its input stream closed before I can read any of the processes output,
but I can't close the bidirectional stream yet, because I still need
to read from it.

The docs don't look like anything's different, but I'm hoping maybe
someone's figured out something in the meantime, or that maybe the
docs just missed an update…

Just pinging this in hopes that someone has an answer that doesn't
involve piping from echo…
