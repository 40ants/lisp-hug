                <h1>Add new pinboard object on mouse entry</h1>
                <pre>
I need to add a new object to a pinboard-layout when the mouse enters the
layout. But how can I detect the mouse entry as an event? I would have thought
it would be available as a gesture for an input-model, but apparently not... I
know about current-pointer-position, but how would I use that in this context?

Thanks in advance for any suggestions.
Christopher

You will probably have to start a process to monitor when the layout 
pane gets the focus. The discussions found on gmane at 
http://tinyurl.com/cof8m7 related to notification when focus is lost 
should be helpful.

It would be nice to have built-in Lispworks functions to do this since 
it keeps popping up.
