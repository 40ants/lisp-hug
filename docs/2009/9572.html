                <h1>LW 5.1.1 Personal crashes</h1>
                <pre>
Hello,

I use LW 5.1.1 Personal right now.

It has started to crash abruptly with no message or explanations
whatsoever. I start LW, open a file in the editor via the toolbar or
the menu. Then I open (try to open) a second file again via the
toolbar/menu. LW crashes.

I use the editor in the emacs mode. So, I found a workaround. I
open files to LW with ctrl+x, ctrl+f -- everything is all right in
this case.

Does someone have the same problem? Any ideas, explanations? Should I
file a bug report and what info provide with it if LW just crashes
(closes) with no explanations at all? Or it is some sort of a feature
in the Personal edition and if I'm about to upgrade, the bug (or
whatever that is) would be gone?

Best,
 Art

Greetings from the very cold and snowy Rocky Mountains.

I suggest that you re-install the system from start. I can't think of 
anything else.

I have been using LispWorks for two years now and have written close 
to 30,000 lines of Lisp for a commercial product and I have seen 
absolutely zero crashes (lots of my program bugs though :)

It has been, for me, a rock solid system. It *never* "crashes".  I 
would bet that there is something wrong on the install.

Hello Jack,

JH&gt I suggest that you re-install the system from start. I can't think of
JH&gt anything else.

I did that. No luck, still crashes. I use LW Personal on Windows XP.

Will use the emacs mode and ctrl+x ctrl+f to open files.

Also, I have noticed, it only crashes when I open files that are on my
desktop. I have two files on the desktop that I work with right now. I
open first, compile it. Then I open the file dialog to open the second
file and it crashes. But when I moved those two files to a different
location (different disk) they open ok, no crashes.

I think it is a weird thing that is "unique" to a gui part of
LW on Windows.

JH&gt I have been using LispWorks for two years now and have written close
JH&gt to 30,000 lines of Lisp for a commercial product and I have seen 
JH&gt absolutely zero crashes (lots of my program bugs though :)

Some off-topic question: do you know when LW 6 is coming? Should I
wait to buy it or if I but LW5.1 with support the upgrade to the 6 would
cost nothing?


Best,
 Art
