                <h1>Snow Leopard command annoyances</h1>
                <pre>
Has anyone else had this happen? Better yet, does anyone have a fix?  
Ever since I upgraded to OS X Snow Leopard, I often have to hit cmd-c  
twice to copy text (cmd-p twice to paste), and cmd-s twice to save a  
file editing it. The first time beeps at me and doesn't seem to work.  
Not a show stopper, but quite annoying to the flow of my productivity.

Cheers,
JD

Yes. I think there's already been a couple of reports.

No. I think that the people at LW may have to come up with a patch for  
this.

I assume you meant cmd-v here, unless you changed it in the Keyboard  
Pane of System Prefs.

It's become nearly reflexive for me as well. Hopefully it'll be  
patched soon. Don't be surprised if it's a bug in Snow Leopard - I  
notice that several applications (TextEdit, for example) no longer  
have a functioning Open Recent submenu (i.e., it's always empty), so  
there may be some general menu related flakiness in 10.6.x

warmest regards,

Ralph

&gt Did you set your Recent Documents preference to zero?

No, I didn't (it's set to 15). I had numerous recent docs in several  
applications prior to upgrading to Snow Leopard but they have none  
now. I know this is a bug because other cocoa apps (e.g. Preview)  
still show all the recent docs from Leopard under SL.

BTW, as a UI issue, I think it's a mistake to have a global recent  
docs count. It should only be settable per application.

Ralph
