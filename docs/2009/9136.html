	Dear colleagues,

upon request from several potential contributors, we have postponed the
submission deadline for the 6th European Lisp Workshop by two weeks. The new
deadline is now April 22nd.

2009 Special News
=================
This year, and for the first time, the workshop proceedings will be
published in the ACM Digital Library. Also, the workshop will feature
interactive tutorial/demo/coding sessions (see below).


Overview
========
"...Please don't assume Lisp is only useful for Animation and
Graphics, AI, Bio-informatics, B2B and E-Commerce, Data Mining,
EDA/Semiconductor applications, Expert Systems, Finance, Intelligent
Agents, Knowledge Management, Mechanical CAD, Modeling and Simulation,
Natural Language, Optimization, Research, Risk Analysis, Scheduling,
Telecom, and Web Authoring just because these are the only things they
happened to list."
  -- Kent Pitman

Lisp, one of the eldest computer languages still in use today, is
gaining momentum again. The structure of Lisp makes it easy to extend
the language or even to implement entirely new dialects without
starting from scratch, making it the ideal candidate for writing
Domain Specific Languages. Common Lisp, with the Common Lisp Object
System (CLOS), was the first object-oriented programming language to
receive an ANSI standard and retains the most complete and advanced
object system of any programming language, while influencing many
other object-oriented programming languages that followed.

This workshop will address the near-future role of Lisp-based
languages in research, industry and education. We solicit
contributions that discuss the opportunities Lisp provides to capture
and enhance the possibilities in software engineering. We want to
promote lively discussion between researchers proposing new approaches
and practitioners reporting on their experience with the strengths and
limitations of current Lisp technologies.

The workshop will have two components: there will be formal talks, and
interactive turorial/demo/coding sessions.


Papers
======
Formal presentations in the workshop should take between 20 minutes
and half an hour; additional time will be given for questions and
answers. Suggested topics include (but are not limited to):

- Experience reports / Case studies
- Educational approaches
- Software Evolution
- Development Aids
- Persistent Systems
- Dynamic Optimization
- Implementation techniques
- Hardware Support
- Efficiency / Distribution / Parallel programming
- Macro-, reflective-, meta- and/or rule-based development approaches
- Protocol Meta-programming and Libraries
- Context-Oriented, Domain-Oriented and Generative Programming


Interactive Tutorial/Demo/Coding Sessions
=========================================
Additionally, we invite less formal talks in the form of interactive
tutorial/demo/coding sessions. The purpose of these sessions is to
both demonstrate and receive feedback on any interesting Lisp system,
either stable or under development. Being less formal than technical
paper presentations, it is expected that these sessions be highly
interactive.


Submission Guidelines
=====================
Potential contributors are encouraged to submit:

- a long paper (around 10 pages) presenting scientific and/or
  empirical results about Lisp-based uses or new approaches for
  software engineering purposes,

- a short essay (5 pages) defending a position about where
  research, practice or education based on Lisp should be heading in
  the near future,

- a proposal for an interactive tutorial/demo/coding session (1-2
  pages) describing the involved library or application, and the
  subject of the session.

Papers (both long and short) should be formatted following the ACM
SIGS guidelines (see
http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates) and
include ACM classification categories and terms (see
http://www.acm.org/about/class/1998). Authors will later be required
to sign an ACM copyright form.

Submissions should be mailed as PDF to Didier Verna
(didier@lrde.epita.fr) before the submission deadline.
