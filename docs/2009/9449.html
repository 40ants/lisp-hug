<p>
Hi Lisp Hug Lispworks,<br />
Today when electricity is so crucial, we need to take small steps in our everyday lives to save energy.</p>
<p>We are all internet savvy and we google a lot for searches. A blog post proposed the theory that a black version of the Google search engine would save a fair bit of energy due to the popularity of the search engine.</p>
<p style="font-size:10px;color:#000000;padding:0 20px"><i>Take at look at Google, who gets about 200 million queries a day. Let's assume each query is displayed for about 10 seconds; that means Google is running for about 550,000 hours every day on some desktop. Assuming that users run Google in full screen mode, the shift to a black background will save a total of 15 (74-59) watts. That turns into a global savings of 8.3 Megawatt-hours per day, or about 3000 Megawatt-hours a year. Now take into account that about 25 percent of the  are CRTs, and at 10 cents a kilowatt-hour, that's $75,000, a goodly amount of energy and dollars for changing a few color codes.</i></p>
<a target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;color:#B71313" href="http://www.laalten.com/"><b>Laalten.com</b></a> was created inspired by this idea. It is a custom search engine powered by Google.
<p>I hope you have got the point. <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;color:#B71313" href="http://www.laalten.com/"><b>Laalten.com</b></a> saves energy because the screen is predominantly black. A given monitor requires more power to display a white (or light) screen than a black (or dark) screen.</p>
Start using <a target="_blank" style="color:#B71313" href="http://www.laalten.com/"><b>Laalten.com</b></a> right away for your google searches and set it as your home page..
<p>Please spread the good word among your friends, neighbours and forward this email to as many peoply as you can. Lets use www.laalten.com and save energy.</p>
<a target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;color:#B71313" href="http://www.laalten.com/"><b>Laalten jalao, Electricity bachao.</b></a>
<p>What I am asking is only that you make a small change in your life to help future generations by using <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;color:#B71313" href="http://www.laalten.com/"><b>Laalten.com</b></a> when searching on the Internet. If we all come together we can cause change for the better and save a ton of energy.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br /><b>
