                <h1>reading #s in delivered application</h1>
                <pre>
My delivered application should read a structure written in a file as "#S(RESULT :QUERY ...",
but breaks with "Error: RESULT is not a proper structure name."
The package in which the structure is defined is added to 
:packages-to-keep and :structure-packages-to-keep
the symbol result is added to 
:keep-symbols and :keep-symbol-names
and
 :keep-structure-info :slots 
is also defined in the call to deliver. delivery level is 0 (on windows 5.0.2)

What am I missing ?

Thank you for any help.

Hello Frank,


| My delivered application should read a structure written in a file as
| "#S(RESULT :QUERY ...", but breaks with "Error: RESULT is not a proper
| structure name." The package in which the structure is defined is added
| to :packages-to-keep and :structure-packages-to-keep
| the symbol result is added to
| :keep-symbols and :keep-symbol-names
| and
|  :keep-structure-info :slots
| is also defined in the call to deliver. delivery level is 0 (on windows
| 5.0.2)
| 
| What am I missing ?

As :keep-structure-info is implied by :structure-packages-to-keep and
:keep-lisp-reader is T by default on level 0, I can only advise to ensure
that you are reading the file in the proper package, e.g.

(let ((*package* (find-package "my-package")))
   (read stream ...))
