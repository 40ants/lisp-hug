Hello,

I am relatively new to the current LispWorks (I did use it in grad school about ten years ago), and I'm having trouble getting the Profiler to work for. I tried just the simple example given in the documentation, but the Profile only ever shows me lisp function calls. I've tried playing around with package and symbol settings, but this doesn't help. Am I missing something obvious? Thanks.

Lonnell,

I have also had trouble getting the profiler to show me useful 
information at time. You might find this thread helpful -  
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.lispworks.general/7015/focus=7016. It 
is sometimes worthwhile to play around with the profiler at the REPL at 
least as a sanity check.

Also, Martin Simmons gave me this helpful advice in a reply to a message 
in which I said I did not get any output from the profiler example:

There are two main problems [with the example]:

1) It doesn't run for long enough on a modern fast machine, so the profiler
  never sees it.

2) CAPI:CONTAIN creates a new thread to run the interface, which the 
profiler
  doesn't show because it is confined to profiling the thread running the
  form.

I suggest using an example like this:

(dotimes (x 1000)
 (capi:make-container
    (make-instance 'capi:title-pane
               :text "Title")))

which runs for longer and doesn't try to display any of the windows so 
doesn't
create extra threads.

Mitch

Here is what I do to profile code: Say I have two packages that I wish
to profile SIEVE and VMATCH, and the entry function is PERFORM-SIEVE:

  SIEVE&gt (hcl:set-up-profiler :packages '(:sieve :vmatch))  
  SIEVE&gt (hcl:profile (perform-sieve))

I don't use the IDE myself, but there are ways to do this in the IDE as
well.

Cheers,
Chris Dean
