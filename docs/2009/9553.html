Hi list,

When I use 24-bit bmps in the toolbar in my app they don't appear, instead
there's just a black square where the image should be. This has been posted
about before; has anyone found the actual source of the problem, and possibly a
solution? If not, does anyone know some decent-looking icon sets that use
256-colour bitmaps? Currently I'm just converting from 24-bit, and the result is
often not very satisfactory.

Thanks in advance,
Chris

Are you sure the user will appreciate 24-bit graphics on 18x18 buttons?

YMMV, 256 colors are enough for any "normal" application, except for image
processing software. Using more colors sounds like overkill to me despite of
MS's recommendation. They have not invented icon set more decent than in
Windows 98/2000 and Office 97 :-)

Personally. I use 16-color bitmaps for toolbars.

While this may (or may not) be true for current versions of Windows, it certainly isn't true for Mac OS X. Native Mac OS X apps have been using toolbar icons with more than 256 colors for about a decade now, and not just image processing software. For example, my newsreader, Unison, uses 32-bit color pngs for its toolbar icons. This is one of the things that makes the typical windows app look cheezy compared to the typical Mac OS X app. Since CAPI is cross platform, I would hope that in this case, cross platform doesn't have to mean lowest common denominator.

warmest regards,

Ralph
