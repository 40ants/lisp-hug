                <h1>www-utils::notify-log-window</h1>
                <pre>A thread safe macro like with-output-to-editor-stream should be  
provided by Lispworks so users do not need to wedge specialized code  
into their applications

It looks to me like one the point is locked, we have captured a lock  
on the editor buffer, so this macro should be fairly easy to write.

The way this is written we are going to cons strings for each entry.

It would be better to pass a closure that just prints out the line.

queue in order to avoid blocking threads.

IIUC there is a concern because of the function tries to keep track of
the lines outputted and the output limit.  However this is just an
editor buffer, and a user may well M-x Clear Output the lines or select
and delete lines, in which case the information maintained by cl-http
becomes invalid/out of sync.  Perhaps this is not the place for
bookkeeping *log-window-output-line-count*.

If this aspect were handled separately, perhaps one could call the
editor function directly with CAPI:APPLY-IN-PANE-PROCESS directly and
punt all lock handling.  (I expect they already take care of it)

Would something like the following not be threadsafe?

(define notify-log-window2 (format-string &amp;rest format-args)
  (flet ((write-entry (stream format-string format-args)
	   (fresh-line stream)
	   (write-char #\[ stream)
	   (http::write-standard-time (get-universal-time) stream)
	   (write-string "]  " stream)
	   (etypecase format-string
             (string
              (apply #'format stream format-string format-args))
             (function (funcall format-string stream)))))
    (let* ((stream  *log-window-output-stream*)
	   (pane (editor:window-text-pane
		  (editor::editor-stream-window *log-window-output-stream*))))
      (capi:apply-in-pane-process
       pane #'write-entry stream format-string format-args))))

[I'd  handle  buffer-truncate-lines-to-limit from a different thread]
