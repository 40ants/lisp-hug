* This year, and for the first time, the workshop proceedings
  will be published in the ACM Digital Library.



Overview
========
"...Please don't assume Lisp is only useful for Animation and
Graphics, AI, Bio-informatics, B2B and E-Commerce, Data Mining,
EDA/Semiconductor applications, Expert Systems, Finance, Intelligent
Agents, Knowledge Management, Mechanical CAD, Modeling and Simulation,
Natural Language, Optimization, Research, Risk Analysis, Scheduling,
Telecom, and Web Authoring just because these are the only things they
happened to list."
  -- Kent Pitman

Lisp, one of the eldest computer languages still in use today, is
gaining momentum again. The structure of Lisp makes it easy to extend
the language or even to implement entirely new dialects without
starting from scratch, making it the ideal candidate for writing
Domain Specific Languages. Common Lisp, with the Common Lisp Object
System (CLOS), was the first object-oriented programming language to
receive an ANSI standard and retains the most complete and advanced
object system of any programming language, while influencing many
other object-oriented programming languages that followed.

This workshop will address the near-future role of Lisp-based
languages in research, industry and education. We solicit
contributions that discuss the opportunities Lisp provides to capture
and enhance the possibilities in software engineering. We want to
promote lively discussion between researchers proposing new approaches
and practitioners reporting on their experience with the strengths and
limitations of current Lisp technologies.



Programme
=========
In addition to Edi Weitz's keynote address, the workshop will feature four
technical papers and two tutorials. Please visit the programme web page
(http://elw2009.bknr.net/programme) for a detailed description.
