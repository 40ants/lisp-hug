                     3rd European Lisp Symposium
                     ===========================
               &lt;http://www.european-lisp-symposium.org&gt


May 6-7, 2010, Fundacao Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisbon, Portugal

Important Dates 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  + Submission Deadline: *January 29, 2010*
  + Author Notification: March 1, 2010
  + Final Paper Due: March 26, 2010
  + Symposium: *May 6-7, 2010*

  We hope, as in previous years, to invite authors of accepted
  research contributions to submit an extended version of their papers
  to a special issue of the Journal of Universal Computer Science
  (J.UCS).

Scope 
~~~~~~
  The purpose of the European Lisp Symposium is to provide a forum
  for the discussion and dissemination of all aspects of design,
  implementation and application of any of the Lisp dialects.  We
  encourage everyone interested in Lisp to participate.

  The European Lisp Symposium 2010 invites high quality papers about
  novel research results, insights and lessons learned from practical
  applications, and educational perspectives, all involving Lisp
  dialects, including Common Lisp, Scheme, Emacs Lisp, AutoLisp,
  ISLISP, Dylan, Clojure, and so on.

  Topics include, but are not limited to:
  + Language design and implementation
  + Language integration, interoperation and deployment
  + Development methodologies, support and environments
  + Reflection, protocols and meta-level architectures
  + Lisp in Education
  + Parallel, distributed and scientific computing
  + Large and ultra-large-scale systems
  + Hardware, virtual machine and embedded applications
  + Domain-oriented programming
  + Lisp pearls
  + Experience reports and case studies

  We invite submissions (through EasyChair) in two categories:
  original contributions and tutorials.

  * Original contributions should neither have been published
    previously nor be under review in any other refereed events or
    publication.  Research papers should describe work that advances
    the current state of the art, or presents old results from a new
    perspective.  Experience papers should be of broad interest and
    should describe insights gained from substantive practical
    applications.  The programme committee will evaluate each
    contributed paper based on its relevance, significance, clarity,
    and originality.

  * Tutorial submissions should be extended abstracts of up to four
    pages for in-depth presentations about topics of special interest
    for at least 90 minutes and up to 180 minutes.  The programme
    committee will evaluate tutorial proposals based on the likely
    interest in the topic matter, the clarity of the presentation in
    the extended abstract, and the scope for interactive
    participation.

  The tutorials will run during the symposium on May 6, 2010.
