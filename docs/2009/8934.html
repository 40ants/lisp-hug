I tried a couple of ideas, but none of them worked.  

I did managed to change the items list (which triggered a redisplay but only displaying the original number of columns) and the columns list (which did not trigger a recalc of the layout).  I have had success triggering other kinds of layouts to recalculate themselves by simply setf'ing their layout-descriptions (to the same value - a noop), but even this trick did not work with multi-column-list-panel (n.b. the layout-description of a m.c.l.p. is owned by its capi::parent, but setf'ing it didn't cause a recalculation).

I suspect that you could get around the problem by wrapping a row or column layout around the multi-column-list-panel and punching new capi::description's into the row/column layout, i.e. creating new multi-column-list-panels and overwriting the old ones.
