                <pre>
Hi,

I know this is a recurring question but I am again having trouble  
getting LispWorks Personal Edition to work on Linux.

I am using Ubuntu 8.04 and I installed libmotif3 using Synaptic, which  
gave me:

sven@bladerunner:~/Desktop/lw-install$ locate libXm.so.3
/usr/lib/libXm.so.3
/usr/lib/libXm.so.3.0.2

Still, LispWorks tells me it cannot find libXm.so.3:

sven@bladerunner:~/Desktop/lw-install$ ./lispworks-personal-5-1-1-x86- 
linux

Maybe it is looking in the wrong directory ? Or maybe the standard  
Motif libraries are no good (they are version 2.2.3-2) ?

Any help or pointers greatly appreciated.

Sven

This knowledgebase article may help:
http://www.lispworks.com/kb/f05daf889214217a80256c5a004c9b12.html.
It's a bit out of date, in that it says libXm.so.3 "appears to be"
binary incompatible, but I use it and it works.  (I'm on Debian, but
isn't Ubuntu a Debian-descendent?  Or have I got my wires crossed?)

My /usr/local/lib/LispWorks/lib/5-1-0-0/config/use-motif-library says

  (:detect-version (("/usr/X11R6/lib/libXm.so.3" :motif))
   :prefer-version :motif
   )

but on the other hand it also says

  NOTE: THIS FILE IS NO LONGER USED BY LISPWORKS IN THE DEFAULT
  CONFIGURATION.

so YMMV.  (Note that I'm talking about the Professional version, but I
think it's pretty much the same for the Personal version, just a
different path.)

HTH.

Are you using a 32-bit lispworks on a 64-bit Ubuntu, by any chance?  I
tried that and ran into a similar problem.  Ubuntu 8.10, x86_64, with
ia32-libs installed (in its default /usr/lib32 directory).

Unfortunately, ia32-libs does not contain the motif libraries.  I
solved it by manually downloading libmotif3_2.2.3-2_i386.deb and
libmotif-dev_2.2.3-2_i386.deb from packages.ubuntu.com.  I unpacked
each package with "dpkg -x" to a temporary directory, dug down into
the package-relative usr/lib, and did a 'sudo cp -ira * /usr/lib32/'.

I can't remember if I did a ldconfig afterwards or not, but I don't
think so.  Anyway, after that my 32-bit lispworks fired up its gui
without problems.  So now I can run both 64-bit and 32-bit lispworks
on the same box, yay!

(BTW, I'm using Enterprise Edition, not that I think it matters in
this case.)
