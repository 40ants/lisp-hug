                <h1>gp:draw-lines</h1>
                <pre>
I've been optimizing some code recently by passing long sequences to
gp:draw-lines on large arrays instead of calling gp:draw-line for each
line. This works very well, but my sequences are sometimes so long
(up to 20000 elements) that I get a stack overflow.

So consider this an informal enhancement request to the Lispworks guys
to change the implementation of gp:draw-lines to a non-recursive one!

Regarding the recent optimization discussion: I think I can avoid
having to implement cluttering caching mechanisms by instead looking
harder into what my code is actually spending its time doing. For
instance, I discovered that I had been too sloppy setting the size of
one large and complicated drawn-pinboard-object. The consequence was
that there was a slight overlap with a frequently updated pinboard
object - which triggered a full redraw of the drawn-pinboard-object
instead of just a tiny redraw of one end of it. When I'm done
implementing the fix, I'm expecting reducing cpu usage (in certain
situations) to less than 10%.

I'll second that. I've had overflows with a couple of hundred lines or so.

Hi Espen,<br><br>Apologies if this observation is not relevant to your case but if you are drawing 20000 elements (is that lines or coordinate tetrads?) how much of that is finally visible? I have a massive amount of data to process and draw (audio waveforms), but most of the time (unless I'm zooming in) I'm drawing from a summary of my data - essentially I down-sample it, leaving me with a general overview. This, by far, is what has given me the biggest speed up. I'm also using gp:draw-lines, passing a vector of values. I only use buffering to avoid flicker on XP, and to manage scrolling and damaged regions.<br><br>Chris<br><br>&gt; From: ev@netfonds..no<br>&gt; To: lisp-hug@lispworks.com<br>&gt; Subject: gp:draw-lines<br>&gt; Date: Tue, 22 Dec 2009 12:45:47 +0100<br>&gt; <br>&gt; <br>&gt; I've been optimizing some code recently by passing long sequences to<br>&gt; gp:draw-lines on large arrays instead of calling gp:draw-line for each<br>&gt; line.
