                <h1>Multiple calls to draw-line</h1>
                <pre>
I have a display-callback that draws a grayscale sonogram from fft data. To do 
this I'm making a lot of calls to draw-line, since (obviously) I need to draw 
each line, representing a frequency bin, with a different grayscale value 
(hence I can't use draw-lines or draw-polygon). This seems to slow the code up 
considerably. Here is the core loop within the function:

(let ((fft/2 (/ *fft-size* 2))
      (bin-width (round (/ %scroll-height% (/ *sample-rate* *fft-size*))))
      (delta (round (/ %scroll-width% *n-frames*))))
  (loop for k of-type fixnum being the hash-key of *spectrum*
        for fr of-type (simple-array double-float (*)) = (gethash k *spectrum*)
	for time of-type fixnum = (* delta k)
        do		  
	(loop for i of-type fixnum from 0 below fft/2
	      for freq = (the fixnum (rescale (* i bin-width) 
                                              (* bin-width fft/2) 
                                              %scroll-height%)) 
              for mag = (the double-float (aref fr (- fft/2 1 i)))
	      when (&gt= mag *cut-off*)
	      do
	      (gp:draw-line pixmap 
			    time freq (+ time delta) freq
		            :thickness bin-width
			    :foreground (make-gray (rescale (float mag 0.0s0)
                                                            *cut-off* 
                                                            1))))))

I have of course profiled, and whilst draw-line didn't seem to be on top of the 
stack a lot I still feel it's the culprit. I can't see a way to optimize this 
any more, so is there a different way I could do this, without having to make 
so many calls to draw-line?

Help/suggestions greatly appreciated,
Chris

Hello Christopher,

The biggest speedup comes from avoiding I/O to the screen. So draw  
into an off-screen pixmap first, and then render all at once as an  
image copy operation from that pixmap to the screen.

I don't know if it's possible with the API you use, but with X or  
other drawing systems, we could  speed this up by filling a polyline  
with a pattern (pixmap) having the wanted grayscale shades.

Or even easier, using that grayscale shade as a background and fill  
the complement polyline in black.

In either case, things could be cached in the window server and only  
one polyline drawing instruction would have to be issued.
