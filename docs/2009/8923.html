Thanks for the tip Jochen, i have looked at the com example but since i don't have experience with COM i'll need to play with it before it does what i need.

You can embed IE via COM - I think there is also something about that  
in the COM examples.

Hi, thanks for a hint. I found this example that works fine on my Mac 
LispWorks 5 Pro.

(defmacro @ (&amp;body body) `(objc:invoke ,@body))
(defmacro @into (&amp;body body) `(objc:invoke-into ,@body))
(defmacro @pool (&amp;body body) `(objc:with-autorelease-pool () ,@body))

(defun framework-path-list ()
   (@pool
     (loop with framework-vector = (@into 'array "NSBundle" "allFrameworks")
           for elt across framework-vector collect (@into 'string elt 
"bundlePath"))))

(defun load-webkit ()
   (@pool
     (@ (@ "NSBundle" "bundleWithPath:"
          (@ (@ "NSString" "stringWithString:" 
"/System/Library/Frameworks/WebKit.framework/")
            "stringByStandardizingPath"))
       "load")))

(defun load-framework (framework-path-string)

     (let* ((request
             (@ "NSURLRequest" "requestWithURL:" (@ "NSURL"

            (web-view
             (make-instance 'capi:cocoa-view-pane :view-class "WebView"

Wow - this would be amazing. I'm not sure if the .nib file integration  
is absolutely essential (though of course it would be really useful  
and cool as well). But having the equivalent of a capi-cocoa-view-pane  
on Windows would make my life a lot easier as well.

Happy New Year and Warmest Regards,

I have lots of documentation that could be easy to translate to HTML 
(automatically, from the ASCII files), but would require huge work to 
make publishing quality docs within LW. The documents need also 
evaluation that would dynamically fill up the HTML template with 
graphs.

Also, the user should be able to evaluate selection on the HTML page 
.... integrated LW editor &amp; listener pane with COCOA functionality 
would be cool.

I tried mixin capi:cocoa-view-pane + 
listener-pane/interactive-pane/editor-pane in order to be able to 
just copy text from the web-view pane --&gt error.

Maybe there is another solution. Now it looks like that the best you 
can get is to have LW menus and buttons that set up a new web page on 
the web-view pane.

&gt&gtHi, thanks for a hint. I found this example that works fine on my

&gt
&gtYes there is also an example of using webkit in LW5 Pro for Mac OS 
&gtX. Actually I would be happy to use webkit in LWW (and LWL) too.
&gtSince Chrome has shown that it runs quite well on windows I think 
&gtthat this could really be an interesting thing.
&gt
&gtI will need an integrated HTML browser in at least one of my 
&gtproducts. Until now there are only some examples using COM (IE) and 
&gtCocoa (Webkit). Having a well done and transparently integrated HTML 
&gtview within CAPI could be very valuable. One could not only use it 
&gtto display actual websites but also use the very sophisticated 
&gtrendering engines to create rich user interfaces (Think iTunes 
&gtStore). AFAIK even Apples wordprocessor "Pages" is built using 
&gtWebkit. Often it is much easier to translate some documents into 
&gtHTML and then just show them in an HTML view instead of creating a 
&gtnew view from scratch.
&gt
&gtA Sidenote:

&gtit is a real pleasure to work with. There is a project called

&gtthink it would be cool and useful - one could even build GUIs using 
&gtNIB files created with the XCode Interface Builder.
&gt
&gtAnother Sidenote:
&gtMy main development and product platform is Mac OS X - It would be 
&gtreally nice to see more integration of Cocoa and CAPI in future. I 
&gtthink it's actually quite cool to be able to use Cocoa-Views within 
&gtCAPI-panes - but could also imagine the opposite: Using a CAPI pane 
&gtwithin a (Interface Builder constructed) Cocoa-View. Just think 
&gtabout embedding the LispWorks-Editor in an application that uses a 
&gtNIB-based Cocoa-GUI.
