I'm writing software to monitor refrigeration temperatures at my  
natural food store, and I want my system to make phone calls in the  
event of an anomaly.

It seems to me that this could be done with no additional hardware  
through an internet-based phone service like Skype. Does anyone have  
an idea what it would take to do this in LispWorks?

Some less-desirable solutions would be to use email or to employ a  
separate product such as PhoneValet. I'm using the Mac platform.

Thanks for your help.

If this is for a product (as opposed to a one-off), I'd look into ContactID (the standard for alarm monitoring).

If it's just a one-off, I'd recommend SMS (via an email gateway presumably) as a first/most obvious contact means, or to look into Asterisk if it absolutely has to be a phone call (as opposed to just "something that will make my phone make noise")

You can also look at SIP instead of Skype (which is proprietary).  
There may be webservices of SIP providers (e. g. SIPGATE.de) or you  
just use some open source SIP softphone implementation to implement it.

Google Voice may be another option (though I have no idea if they  
actually support this)... Hmmm, you could use the "alex" voice ti d  
the talking!

This just came across my RSS feed for Hacker News, and may also address your concern (turn a development hassle into a $30/month opex cost).

I have no affiliation with them, not even as a customer:
