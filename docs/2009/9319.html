                <h1>More delivery on Mac</h1>
                <pre>
I have succeeded in delivering a "standalone" application on the Mac  
using the LispWorks Application Builder tool. Thanks for the help on  
that.

Two problems, though:

1) The application doesn't quite stand alone. Terminal runs along with  
my application. Am I stuck with this, or can someone point me to the  
documentation (or oral tradition, as necessary) that tells me how to  
avoid having Terminal running at the same time?

2) My text-input-panes allow me to highlight text, but not to edit it.  
Is there some module required for that, or what?

OK, I see something more interesting with item #2. My key presses are  
going to other applications. I'm guessing I need callbacks for my text- 
input-panes. It was nice getting that handled "for free" in my  
undelivered program.
