Hi,

I'm moving some code from 4.4 to 5.1 and I notice that using (use-package :sql) in :cl-user results 
in conflicting symbols as shown here:

Using package SQL results in name conflicts for these symbols: EXECUTE-COMMAND EXECUTE-QUERY 
WITH-TRANSACTION.

Are these symbols in cl-user by mistake or is it expected ? I've read nothing in the release notes 
that documents it.

Finally, can I just shadow them without any troubles?

Cheers,

Sebastien.

Could it be that you have been using or experimenting with CL- 
PREVALENCE ( http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-prevalence/ ) ?  These  
symbols are exported by the cl-prevalence package.  But unless you are  
USE-ing that package in cl-user, they shouldn't be *in* cl-user.  In  
case of conflicts between packages, you should either don't USE them  
and keep referencing symbols by fully qualifying the names as in CL- 
PREVALENCE:EXECUTE-COMMAND or work with SHADOWING.

HTH,

Sven
