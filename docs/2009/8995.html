                <h1>Problems with FUNCALLABLE-STANDARD-CLASS</h1>
                <pre>
Hello,

I'm trying to create a new FUNCALLABLE-STANDARD-CLASS and always get  
an error if I do so. I've reduced it to the following examples.

The following works:

(defclass mixin-without-slots () ())
(defclass my-funcallable-instance (mixin-without-slots  
clos:funcallable-standard-object)
   ()
   (:metaclass clos:funcallable-standard-class))

  (let ((fn (make-instance 'my-funcallable-instance)))
    (set-funcallable-instance-funcation fn (lambda (a b) (+ a b)))
    (funcall fn 2 3))


But the following raises a condition when defining the class.

(defclass mixin-with-slot () (a))
(defclass my-buggy-funcallable-instance (mixin-with-slot  
clos:funcallable-standard-object)
   ()
   (:metaclass clos:funcallable-standard-class))

Error: #&lt;STANDARD-CLASS MIXIN-WITH-SLOT 22DEAEFB&gt is an invalid  
superclass of #&lt;FUNCALLABLE-STANDARD-CLASS MY-BUGGY-FUNCALLABLE- 
INSTANCE 22E291A7&gt.

Does anybody know this?
Is there something wrong with this code?

ciao,
Jochen

Your code is correct according to the CLOS MOP specification. However,  
LispWorks has the limitation that standard-class and funcallable- 
standard-class are not compatible with each other in the general case.  
The case that it happens to work if the standard-class doesn't define  
any slots is an exception.

The only way out of this is to duplicate the class hierarchy and make  
one version of the hierarchy be all funcallable-standard-class (and  
keep the original as standard-class). Closer to MOP also doesn't fix  
this - it's just not possible without tweaking internal implementation  
details.

Allegro Common Lisp and CMUCL currently have the same limitation. (In  
general, the generic function protocols are the least stable in most  
CLOS MOP implementations, with different problems everywhere.)  
(LispWorks is actually one of the best ones IMHO. ;)

I hope this helps.

Best,
Pascal

Another exception is when you define your own subclass of
funcallable-standard-class, and I think that's a good workaround:

(defclass my-funcallable-meta-class (funcallable-standard-class)
  ())

(defmethod validate-superclass ((class my-funcallable-meta-class) superclass)
  (declare (ignorable class superclass))
  t)

(defclass mixin-with-slot () (a))

(defclass my-buggy-funcallable-instance (mixin-with-slot
clos:funcallable-standard-object)
  ()
  (:metaclass my-funcallable-meta-class))

(let ((fn (make-instance 'my-buggy-funcallable-instance)))
  (clos:set-funcallable-instance-function fn (lambda (a b) (+ a b)))
  (setf (slot-value fn 'a) 42)
  (values (funcall fn 2 3)
          (slot-value fn 'a)))

I'm using a setup like this in CLPython, and it works reliable in
Allegro and Lispworks. The above code also seems to work on SBCL
1.0.20, but I've encountered problems using more complex classes and
metaclasses.
