                <h1>Leopard + shortcuts</h1>
                <pre>
Hi,

In LW5.0/Leopard I had this annoying problem with erratic Cut/Copy/ 
Paste shortcut behavior. This vanished in 5.1.
Is it just me again or is this now back in Snow Leopard? This time,  
after Pasting, Copy (Command+C) works only when I type the shortcut  
twice. The first time does nothing... after this Copy works until I do  
Paste again... :(

Anybody else has this or do I need to have my head examined?

regards,

Mika

Hi Mika

Please can you confirm the build number of Snow Leopard in which you
see this problem (needing to press the shortcut twice)?

thanks
Dave

I see this same behavior in LWM 5.1.2 64-bit intel, so you are not  
alone. Basically, most keyboard shortcuts, including those defined by  
the user in the Keyboard Shortcuts Systems Pref Pane, requires two  
presses to be recognized by LWM. Sometimes, rarely, it is recognized  
the first time, but it is so much the norm that two key presses are  
required that I've gotten into the habit of hitting cmd-c twice when  
using LWM. Same for cmd-v, cmd-k (which I have bound to Compile and  
Load), cmd-o, etc.

Note that this is not true of editor key chords, including those that  
are defined or redefined by the user. Only command key (aka "apple"  
key) shortcuts.

warmest regards,

Ralph
