                <h1>Delivery on Mac, please?</h1>
                <pre>
I have not yet gotten a reply to my earlier questions.

Can someone tell me, is it possible to deliver a Mac application  
without the Terminal application as its Siamese twin? Am I observing a  
bug (presumably my own), or is this as "standalone" as it gets?

And forgive me if I'm being lazy, but what does it take for a text- 
input-pane to handle key presses in a delivered application? In a non- 
delivered application, I can just type and edit text in a text-input- 
pane, but in my delivered application, I can select text, but when I  
type, other applications (whether Terminal, Text Edit or Mail) respond  
to the key presses.

Hi, Laughing

Yes, you're really lazy, and please read LW official documentation:  
(Creating a Mac OS X application bundle)
