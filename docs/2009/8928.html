Greeting lisp-hug.

Seeking help: I'm looking to harvest some text from the web.

I need a function to return the source html+ for an url, another to 
harvest embedded urls from the source, and another to harvest the 
plaintext from the source.

Someone else already have utils like this?

It's been a while, and I need a jumpstart.  I used to live and breath 
lisp - was a professional developer in NLP applications for many many years.

I'm running Lispworks Pro on a Mac Pro, OSX 10.4.11, if that helps. 
Usually browse through Safari over DSL.
Main questions, I suppose, involve getting to the outside world from my app.

-vbr,

Rich

PS is this an appropriate forum to find lisp developers willing to take 
on small consulting jobs?

In partial answer to my own question...

 &gt For any others who have run into this problem,  I have made a small
 &gt workaround..  Rather, than system:open-url, the following code can be
 &gt used to use the Cocoa bridge to open a url:
 &gt
 &gt (defun open-url-alternative (path)
 &gt    #+mac
 &gt   (objc:invoke (objc:invoke "NSWorkspace" "sharedWorkspace")
 &gt "openURL:" (objc:invoke "NSURL" "URLWithString:" path)
 &gt   #--mac
 &gt   (system:open-url path))

  &gt Try this: (hqn-web::browse "http://www2.siba.fi/PWGL/")

That's good in LispWorks 4.x.

In LispWorks 5.0 the documented API is SYSTEM:OPEN-URL.

#+LispWorks4 (hqn-web::browse "http://www2.siba.fi/PWGL/")
#-LispWorks4 (sys:open-url "http://www2.siba.fi/PWGL/")

Hello Richard,

my approach would be to use drakma (http://www.weitz.de/drakma/) to  
get the page source, then either
    use closure-html (http://common-lisp.net/project/closure/closure- 
html/) to parse html into sexps and then extract urls and plaintext  
form the sexp-ized html,
    or use cl-ppcre (http://weitz.de/cl-ppcre/) if you are happy  
doing processing with regexps.


HTH, Denis

Hi Richard,

Another HTML parser possibility is
