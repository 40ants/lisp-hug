Happy Saturday to the List --

This is my first post.

I have been programming in Lisp since 1972 (started on a UNIVAC 1108 
with Lisp 1.5 on punched cards  :)   but I am quite new to CAPI.

Question: I clearly do not understand the basic use of threads with 
CAPI objects - i.e., exactly when and how to use/coordinate 
capi:execute-with-interface, capi:apply-in-pane-process &amp; friends...

For example:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  (defun test( sleep )

    (let* ((example-interface (capi:display
                                           (make-instance 'capi:interface
                                                                   :best-width 
100
                                                                   :best-height 
100)))

            (example-pane (make-instance 'capi:output-pane
                                                         :background :blue))

            (example-layout (make-instance 'capi:simple-layout
                                                           :description
                                                             (list 
example-pane))))

        (capi:execute-with-interface example-interface
                                                #'(setf capi:pane-layout)
                                                example-layout
                                                example-interface)

        (if (not (null sleep))
            (sleep 1))

        (capi:apply-in-pane-process example-pane
                                               'gp:draw-line
                                               example-pane
                                               0 0 100 100
                                               :foreground :white)))
-------------------------------------------------------------------

(test nil)    does not write a white line on the blue pane but,

(test t)  does.

I understand that CAPI objects are (probably) implemented with each 
being a separate thread -- as the CAPI documentation mumbles a bit about.

The capi:execute-with-interface clearly does nothing but schedule the 
(setf capi:pane-layout) - it does not actually do the setf.

Without the (sleep 1), apparently the capi:apply-in-pane-process 
request for the draw runs in the pane's thread BEFORE the pane is 
attached to the interface - thus, nothing happens.

All that makes sense (kinda, sorta) to me.

What I do not understand is a good -- and very clear -- way to make 
sure that there are no such CAPI timing issues.

If I understands things, there are three (and maybe four) threads 
going on with the above code: the function test; the interface; the 
pane; and maybe even the layout (though probably not).

To really keep things simple, an ideal way would be some method to 
hang until a specific object's actual thread ran and completed but I 
understand that there might be performance issues with that - but, it 
sure would simplify the code.

How do you CAPI grey-beards deal with this sort of timing thing???????

I am of course *very* leery of depending on such hacks as (sleep 1) 
which will obviously fail at some point.

Thoughts?

I really think that should have worked.  The message to add the layout  
should have got there first.
Maybe LW can provide an explanation.  However to synch the two  
processes I would use a
mp:mailbox to synch.

(defun test2 (sleep)
   (let* ((example-interface (capi:display
                              (make-instance 'capi:interface
                                             :best-width 100
                                             :best-height 100)))
          (example-pane (make-instance 'capi:output-pane
                                       :background :blue))

          (example-layout (make-instance 'capi:simple-layout
                                         :description
                                         (list example-pane)))
          (mailbox (mp:make-mailbox)))

     (capi:execute-with-interface example-interface
                                  (lambda ()
                                    (setf (capi:pane-layout example- 
interface) example-layout)
                                    (mp:mailbox-send mailbox t)))
     (mp:mailbox-read mailbox)

     (when sleep (sleep 1))

     (capi:apply-in-pane-process example-pane
                                 'gp:draw-line
                                 example-pane
                                 0 0 100 100
                                 :foreground :white)))

(test2 nil) and (test2 t) both work.


In general do not create interfaces that way (though I can see a use  
for it.  Instead I
do something like


(capi:define-interface test ()
   ()
   (:panes
    (example-pane capi:output-pane
                  :background :blue))
   (:layouts
    (main capi:simple-layout '(example-pane))))

(defun test3 (sleep)
   (let ((interface (make-instance 'test :best-width 100 :best-height  
100)))
     (capi:display interface)
     (when sleep (sleep 1))
     (capi:apply-in-pane-process (slot-value interface 'example-pane)
                                 'gp:draw-line (slot-value interface  
'example-pane) 0 0 100 100 :foreground :white)))

Ahh..  I think I know why (test  nil) does not work.  Its because when  
apply-in-pane-process is
called example-pane has no pane-process.  The first message has not  
been procesed yet,
hence the call does nothing.

Happy Sunday to the List...

It is snowing like crazy here at 8,000-feet (2400-meters) in the 
Rocky Mountains - a good day to be working inside here on software :)

I appreciate the replies to my post, "Silly CAPI Newbie Question".

I am glad to know that I am not the only hideously tortured soul 
wandering aimlessly through the orthogonal-to-CAPI night. There are 
apparently a few others :)

I am building a commercial system in Lisp - an embedded (soft) 
real-time mobile/portable device with a touchscreen etc - and it is 
of some importance to me to try to minimize GC stops and the like 
and, thus, I try to minimize the destruction of things there in 
Lisp-Space. This system will run for days, weeks, years at a time.

I appreciate what Paul Tarvydas said about the tortured snippet that 
I posted. The following, as a replacement, seems to work reliably:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(defun test()

   (let* ((example-pane1 (make-instance 'capi:output-pane   ; Blue Pane...
                                        :background :blue
                                        :display-callback
                                          #'(lambda( self x y width height )
                                              (gp:draw-line self 0 0 100 100
                                                            :foreground 
:white))))

          (example-layout1 (make-instance 'capi:simple-layout
                                          :description (list example-pane1)))

          (example-interface (capi:display
                              (make-instance 'capi:interface
                                             :best-width 100
                                             :best-height 100
                                             :layout example-layout1)))

          (example-pane2 (make-instance 'capi:output-pane       ; Red Pane...
                                        :background :red
                                        :display-callback
                                          #'(lambda( self x y width height )
                                              (gp:draw-line self 0 0 100 100
                                                            :foreground 
:white))))

          (example-layout2 (make-instance 'capi:simple-layout
                                          :description (list example-pane2))))


     (sleep 1)   ; Delay so that you can see the Blue Pane with White Line...

     (capi:execute-with-interface example-interface     ; Put up the 
Red Pane and White Line...
                                  #'(setf capi:pane-layout)
                                  example-layout2
                                  example-interface)

;;  Should Now See the other Red Pane with White Line.

))
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I now, above, define the interface, pane, and layout in reverse order 
to what I did before - and, most important I think, is that I now 
first (in the Let*) define the interface with the layout whereas, 
before, I did not do that. I manually/remotely shot that in on-the-fly.

In the above new snippet, I display the blue pane and wait a second 
(so you can see the thing) and then change the layout for the same 
interface to the red pane/layout.

This works every time with no delay etc.

I believe that it works because the interface has a defined pane (and 
thread) before I do anything - unlike before.

Paul asked the question, "Is your real question 'how do I set up a 
capi interface containing an output pane and draw a line (and other 
stuff) on it?'"

I think (after staring at the endlessly falling snow for a bit), that 
my question really is:   "Am I correct to use a single interface that 
overlays my touchscreen and to change the layouts/panes as I flip 
among things (as I do above with the capi:execure-with-interface 
#'(setf capi:pane-layout)? Or, should I destroy the old interface 
every time and put up a new interface/display/pane when I do 
something different and, therefore, never use the 
capi:execute-with-interface?"

This is, I think, what that other tortured and wandering soul, 
"Laughing Water", was asking as well --

Do I remain orthogonal to the CAPI idiom by creating a single defined 
interface that lives forever and that I remotely (setf 
capi:pane-layout) to new layout/pane sets as things change? That is 
the question.

Again, this commercial system that I am building needs to run 
continuously with minimal GC stops and the like. Thus, my 
orthogonalness to the Constantly Destroy The Interface model if I can.

I greatly appreciate the input.

&gt &gt Question: I clearly do not understand the basic use of threads with
&gt &gt CAPI objects - i.e., exactly when and how to use/coordinate
&gt &gt capi:execute-with-interface, capi:apply-in-pane-process &amp; friends...
&gt
&gtYour example is tortured.  You are in the weeds.  I don't mean that 
&gtpejoratively, I'd be glad to steer you in the right direction, I've 
&gtbeen dealing with CAPI for a number of years.   There is a learning curve.
&gt
&gtIs your real question "how do I set up a capi interface containing 
&gtan output pane and draw a line (and other stuff) on it?"  Or are you 
&gttrying to do something insanely tricky where you really need to know 
&gtthe scheduling policies underlying capi?
&gt
&gtIf you are trying to do something simple, like making a GUI, then 
&gtuse CAPI:DEFINE-INTERFACE.  And, use the tools&gt&gtinterface builder wizard.
&gt
&gtTop level interfaces run in native processes.  Any callbacks within 
&gtsuch processes - menus, buttons, mousing, input-models, whatever - 
&gtare handled inside the process and do not require the tortuous 
&gtcapi:execute-with-interface and capi:apply-in-pane-process calls.
&gt
&gtYou only need to use capi:execute-with-interface and 
&gtcapi:apply-in-pane-process if you are trying to affect a GUI that 
&gtyou spawned, say, from the listener, and are trying to shoot remote 
&gtinvocations to it.
&gt
&gtIn the CAPI idiom, you build the entire interface (a tree of capi 
&gtstuff), then capi:display it.  In your example code, you seem to do 
&gtthe opposite - the code you posted calls capi:display on the 
&gtinterface before it has any panes and layouts.  I agree with you 
&gtthat your code does what you claim, but I haven't bothered to figure 
&gtout why - the code you posted is orthogonal to the CAPI idiom. Like 
&gtI said earlier, you are in the weeds and doing things you shouldn't 
&gtbe doing if what you want to accomplish is a simple GUI (your 
&gtquestions would be valid if you want to be doing something amazingly 
&gtcomplicated, but I suspect that that is not what you are asking about).
&gt
&gtIf all you want to do is to build a simple GUI, start by using 
&gttools&gt&gtinterface builder.  Grab a simple layout (e.g. column layout) 
&gtand add a text-input-pane to it.  Then click on the "code" tab and 
&gtsee what the generated code looks like.  Save it.  Run it.  Ta-da.
&gt
&gtHave a look at the examples.  E.G. 
&gtexamples/capi/output-panes/drawing.lisp (which is more complicated 
&gtthan the example that you posted).
&gt
&gtFeel free to ask here again - even if you don't know what question 
&gtto ask.  The learning curve is mysteriously quantized.  It seems 
&gtutterly mysterious until at some discrete moment it all snaps into 
&gtview and looks insanely trivial.

 &gt 
 &gt It is snowing like crazy here at 8,000-feet (2400-meters) in the 
 &gt Rocky Mountains - a good day to be working inside here on software :)
 &gt 
 &gt I appreciate the replies to my post, "Silly CAPI Newbie Question".
 &gt 
 &gt I am glad to know that I am not the only hideously tortured soul 
 &gt wandering aimlessly through the orthogonal-to-CAPI night. There are 
 &gt apparently a few others :)
 &gt 
 &gt I am building a commercial system in Lisp - an embedded (soft) 
 &gt real-time mobile/portable device with a touchscreen etc - and it is 
 &gt of some importance to me to try to minimize GC stops and the like 
 &gt and, thus, I try to minimize the destruction of things there in 
 &gt Lisp-Space. This system will run for days, weeks, years at a time.
 &gt 

I've had good luck with Lispworks in a soft-realtime situation
("real-time" display of flight software telemetry- breaking down the
various telemetry packets and populating their respective grids).  From
a moment-to-moment perspective, simple navigation of the interface did
not interfere with packet processing, however changing layout contents
entailed considerable processing in the interface thread (other LW
threads seemed to continue running fine, delta-t based measurements
acted properly, etc).  I didn't notice any pausing behavior even over
24-hr/day operation up to about a week- though I'd surely miss
occasional transient events.

I believe the layout modifications precipitated a lot of cpu use because
the grids I was modifying consisted of several hundred rows each and
when the interface changed around, 5 of these grids would be modified at
one go.

The upshot being if your interface design is static- meaning, you don't
dynamically create/destroy/add/remove layouts in the interface, then you
probably won't have much trouble from CAPI.

Greg
