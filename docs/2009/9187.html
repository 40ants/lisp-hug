                <h1>cross-compile to iPhone</h1>
                <pre>
     I'm developing a Lispworks application
for reading text with theatrical intonation
that would be great on an iPhone.

     I'm excited to do this,  but the part that computes
intonation consists of about 2 MB of lisp code.
Is there any hope that a Lisp compiler
would ever run on the iPhone,
like Unity C#/Javascript does?

    Or should I try to use Kyoto,
GNU or ECL cross-compilers to C?

If you're talking about an Apple sanctioned app (as opposed to an app  
for jailbroken iPhones) then I'm pretty sure the IPhone developer  
agreement prohibits the use of interpreters.

If this is what you're aiming for, you'd need a lisp-&gtC/Objective-C  
translator. Maybe ecl would not be frowned on by Apple?

Ralph

Apple's no-interpreters restriction is fairly inclusive. I found this  
quote from the iPhone dev agreement on the net:

"An Application may not itself install or launch other executable code  
by any means, including without limitation through the use of a plug- 
in architecture, calling other frameworks, other APIs or otherwise."

It's not at all clear to me that Apple would see, for example, the ecl  
runtime as anything other than a "framework" or "other APIs" whose  
purpose is to "install or launch other executable code." IOW, Apple  
pretty clearly wants devs to use Objective-C and Apple's own  
interpreters (e.g, javascript) and not much else. I don't know if  
Apple would sanction an ecl based lisp app, but they certainly have  
the leeway to deny it if they choose to interpret the dev agreement  
that way.

warmest regards,

Ralph

How about Chicken, which would be Scheme rather than CL, but I believe  
it compiles to C and can be used with XCode?

I'm wondering if the situation for Lisp would be comparable to
Smalltalk. There are apparently applications running on the Squeak VM
available in the App store:

  "In both cases the Squeak VM is running natively on the iPhone
serving pages to a web browser that is displayed on the screen."

It is precisely analogous in that both require a non-apple runtime in  
order to execute. The problem is that Apple have been inconsistent wrt  
what they approve and do not approve. Some apps that require a non- 
apple runtime are approved, some are rejected for using "foreign  
APIs." So it is an open question as to whether Apple would approve  
something that requires the ecl runtime, or libchicken, or the gambit  
runtime, etc. They might even approve one ecl app and not approve  
another - they've apparently done this with other runtimes.
