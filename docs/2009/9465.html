                <h1>text-input-pane and pane focus questions</h1>
                <pre>

- Would it be possible to handle keyboard events (specifically arrow
  keys like &lt;LEFT&gt &lt;UP&gt )in a text-input-pane? perhaps via
  :change-callback

- would text-input-range benefit from a :change-callback

- is there any available mechanism to specify an "ordering" for pane
  focus in a layout

- is there any available mechanism to change the pane focus to the
  "next" pane-to-be-focussed in a layout in response to input events?

Any light shed on these items will be appreciated! Thanks

|
| Not for general input, but left and right already go to the
| :change-callback is the caret moves.

I think the ability to pass on a few non-edit-text-changing-gestures
would be useful, if only to bind to or call existing callbacks: like the
completion prompter or cancel-callback (instead of going through toolbar
buttons)

|&gt - is there any available mechanism to specify an "ordering" for pane
|&gt   focus in a layout
|
| No, not within a single layout (The order is defined by the coordinates).
| However, the overall order is computed using the layout heirarchy so that
| gives some control.
|
| Do you have an example that doesn't work as you would expect?

No, But consider the case of a dialog, where one may validate all input
panes on a submit callback and compute a list of panes with invalid
values.  Now I have a subset of panes which are interesting, and I would
like to appropriate the `next pane' gesture to cycle through this subset
(without disabling other panes)

|&gt - is there any available mechanism to change the pane focus to the
|&gt   "next" pane-to-be-focussed in a layout in response to input events?
|
| CAPI:SET-PANE-FOCUS sets the focus, but you have to choose which pane.

In Motif, the TAB gesture [usually] changes pane focus to the `next
pane' in the order computed by CAPI.  Sometimes, in the context of a
simple-pane, it appears desirable to invoke this action [when the pane
input is valid, or from within the :callback].  I am not sure I can do
this.  It is also desirable to invoke this `default cycle' action from
an output pane where then the TAB gesture is now handled by the
input-model.
