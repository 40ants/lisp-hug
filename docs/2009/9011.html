Should there be some image other than a white rectangle in this
documentation, or does "Figure 8.1" simply mean "the next paragraph"?

I can file a bug report if it's not as it should be.

The PDF version of the User Guide has the figure.

As an aside, why it's a screenshot of a window is beyond me.  I'd
think some kind of text outline

  - kind
    - of
    - like
  - this

would be better.

Good catch! I didn't even think to check the PDF documentation. I also
agree on that it would be better as a text list.

Thanks for the report. We will fix this next time.

We used a screenshot as an easy way to display the hierachy using a
CAPI tree view. Of course we should have generated an indented text
list instead - smaller, text-searchable and harder to lose :)
