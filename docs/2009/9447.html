                <h1>Scroll-bar in divider layout redisplay problem (again)</h1>
                <pre>
Hi list,

I am still trying to find a cure for a problem I posted about a few months ago
(http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.lispworks.general/8944): 
when I place scroll-bars in a layout with a divider the scroll-bars redisplay in
a 'juddery' fashion as the divider is moved
(particularly if dragged quickly). My interface has independent scroll-bars,
rather than ones added via initargs, as it requires
custom scrolling. The problem is illustrated by the test interface below:

(define-interface sb-div-test ()
  ()
  (:panes
    (top-pane output-pane)
    (bottom-pane output-pane)
    (h-scroll scroll-bar)
    (v-scroll scroll-bar
      :orientation :vertical)
    (dummy-pane simple-pane
      :visible-border nil
      :visible-max-width 16
      :visible-max-height 16))
  (:layouts
    (v-scroll-panel column-layout
      '(v-scroll dummy-pane)
      :y-gap 0)
    (panel-1 column-layout
      '(top-pane h-scroll)
      :y-gap 0)
    (panel-2 row-layout
      '(panel-1 v-scroll-panel)
      :x-gap 0)
    (main-layout column-layout
      '(panel-2 :divider bottom-pane)))
  (:default-initargs
    :layout 'main-layout
    :best-height 500
    :best-width 800))

I'm on XP, but the problem also seems to occur (though perhaps less
dramatically) on Vista and OS X. I have tried things like
disabling 'Show window contents while dragging' in the XP preferences, but
nothing seems to work. Interestingly the problem
seems much less obvious if I maximise the interface. Anyone have any thoughts on
how to solve this?

Cheers all,
Chris

Hi Christopher,

Your example works quite fine for me on LWW 5.1.2 pro with Win XP SP3.
However, you can try to use a grid layout instead, which seems to be a litle more fluid on my 
machine. At least, it simplifies the nested layouts.

Cheers,

Sébastien.

   (:panes
    (top-pane output-pane)
    (bottom-pane output-pane)
    (h-scroll scroll-bar)
    (v-scroll scroll-bar :orientation :vertical))
   (:layouts
    (panel capi:grid-layout
          '(top-pane v-scroll h-scroll)
          :orientation :row
          :columns 2
          :x-ratios '(1 0) :x-gap 0
          :y-ratios '(1 0) :y-gap 0
          :visible-border t
          )
    (main-layout column-layout
                 '(panel :divider bottom-pane)))
   (:default-initargs
    :layout 'main-layout
    :best-height 500
    :best-width 800))

two other XP machines since posting, and had no issues, so it seems as
if it's just a problem with my box. I have no idea what can be causing
it, however, as I haven't made any radical changes to the OS's
configuration, either graphics or otherwise. Anyway, at least I know
now that it's not a general problem!<br>
<br>
Thanks again,<br>
Chris<br>
<br>
P.S: Oh and thanks also for suggesting using a grid-layout rather than
nested column- and row-layouts. I had never used a grid-layout before,
having regarded it as somewhat of an abstraction. But it's obviously
useful for a complex interface.<br> 		 	   		  <br /><hr />New Windows 7: Simplify what you do everyday. <a href='http://www.microsoft.com/uk/windows/buy/' target='_new'>Find the right PC for you.</a></body>
