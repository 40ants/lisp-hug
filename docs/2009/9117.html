                <h1>Problem with C callback (PortAudio)</h1>
                <pre>
I have written some bindings for PortAudio, a widely-used cross-platform C
audio API. It requires a callback, which is called continuously while audio is
required. It works, but I often encounter the following error -

Error: Exception C0000005 [flags 0] at 218313C

On my Mac I simply get this -

Bus error(10) [code F068C678] at C

The callback itself takes the following form (I'm using CFFI) -

(defcallback process-samples :int ((input :pointer) 
                                   (output :pointer) 
			           (frames-per-buffer :ulong) 
                                   (time-info pa-stream-callback-time-info) 
                                   (status-flags pa-stream-callback-flags)
	                           (user-data :pointer))
  (declare (ignore input time-info status-flags user-data))
  (loop with n-samps = (length *samples*)		 
        for i from 0 below frames-per-buffer
        for j = (+ *counter* i)		  
	if (&lt; j n-samps)
	do (setf (mem-aref output :float i) (aref *samples* j))	  
	else do
          (setf *counter* 0)
          (return 1)
	finally 
	(setf *counter* (+ *counter* frames-per-buffer))
	(return 0)))
		
This simply writes samples from the Lisp array *samples* to the output audio
buffer in blocks of size frames-per-buffer (in this case 2048). While the 
callback returns 0 it continues to be called, returning 1 stops it. The 
variable *counter* stores the current position within the sample buffer.

I suspect the error I'm getting may be due to GC occurring during the callback 
process, thus moving objects which the foreign code is still pointing to. I've 
declared my samples buffer static to hopefully account for this, but the error 
remains. The callback lives in its own thread, so possibly it's a 
multi-threading problem... Plus I'm calling PortAudio from a menu in my main 
interface, which adds possibly another level of complication...

PortAudio also has a non-callback interface, which causes no problems, but the 
advantage of the callback approach is that it allows me to update various 
variables on a 'per sample' basis. More info on this can be found at 
http://www.portaudio.com/trac/wiki/TutorialDir/WritingACallback.

Any help/suggestions greatly appreciated.

Chris

Hi Chris,

this is just a rough guess. Did you compile the callback function?
Interpreted code is slow in Lispworks AFAIK. This might be a problem in
audio processing.

This might happen if PortAudio creates a new thread to perfrom the  
callback.

&gt &gt
&gt &gt Thanks guys. I thought sys:setup-for-alien-threads wasn't necessary any  
&gt &gt more,
&gt &gt however, and had been removed.
&gt 
&gt It is no longer necessary in the latest version of Lispworks.

Correct.  In fact, the function is no longer defined in LispWorks 5.1.


&gt                                                               However this  
&gt does not apply to callbacks from unknown foreign threads. If PortAudio  
&gt spawns a new thread and the new thread calls back into Lispworks then you  
&gt will see random crashes all over the place.

That might be a bug.  New threads can call back into LispWorks, unless they
have some particularly strange environmental requirements (though I can't
think of any offhand).
