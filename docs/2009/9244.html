                <h1>LOOP variable type declarations and initialization values, different LOOP 
                 expansions on OS X &amp; Win32?</h1>
                <pre>
Hello all,

If I've got a user-defined type for which LW might not know how to
construct a "default" value for, I can get different macroexpansions
for LOOP on OS X and Win32. (LW 5.1.2). For instance, consider the
type "int-pair" which is a cons of two integers, and a function which
iterates over a list of int-pairs, printing each one.

(deftype int-pair () '(cons integer integer))

(defun print-int-pair (int-pairs)
  (loop for x of-type int-pair in int-pairs
        doing (print x)))

In compiling print-int-pair on Win32, there are no output messages.
However, on OS X, I get

;;;*** Warning in PRINT-INT-PAIR: Variable X is declared type
INT-PAIR, but is bound to a value of type NULL

Examining the macroexpansion on OS X shows why such a warning is signaled:

(BLOCK NIL
  (MACROLET ((LOOP-FINISH () '(GO #:|end-loop-15120|)))
    (LET ((X (LOAD-TIME-VALUE 'NIL)) (#:|tail-15123| INT-PAIRS)
(#:|by-15124| 'SYSTEM:CDR$CONS))
      (DECLARE (TYPE INT-PAIR X))
      (TAGBODY
       #:|begin-loop-15119| (PROGN
                              (WHEN (OR (ENDP #:|tail-15123|)) (GO
#:|end-loop-15120|))
                              (LET ((#:|temp-15126| (FUNCALL
#:|by-15124| #:|tail-15123|))
                                    (#:|temp-15125| (SYSTEM:CAR$CONS
#:|tail-15123|)))
                                (SETQ X #:|temp-15125|)
                                (SETQ #:|tail-15123| #:|temp-15126|)))
               (PRINT X)
               (GO #:|begin-loop-15119|)
       #:|end-loop-15120| (RETURN-FROM NIL NIL)))))

The initial value of X is (load-time-value 'nil) which, such enough,
isn't a cons of an integer and an integer.  Now, whether LW should be
able to determine an appropriate with which to initialize X is one
question [1], but I'm more concerned at the moment with why the
warning isn't signaled on Win32.  The macroexpansion shows why:

(BLOCK NIL
 (MACROLET ((LOOP-FINISH () '(GO #:|end-loop-693|)))
   (LET ((X NIL) (#:|tail-696| INT-PAIRS) (#:|by-697| 'SYSTEM:CDR$CONS))
     (DECLARE (TYPE (OR NULL INT-PAIR) X))
     (TAGBODY
      #:|begin-loop-692| (PROGN
                           (WHEN (OR (ENDP #:|tail-696|)) (GO #:|end-loop-693|))
                           (LET ((#:|temp-699| (FUNCALL #:|by-697|
#:|tail-696|))
                                 (#:|temp-698| (SYSTEM:CAR$CONS #:|tail-696|)))
                             (SETQ X #:|temp-698|)
                             (SETQ #:|tail-696| #:|temp-699|)))
              (PRINT X)
              (GO #:|begin-loop-692|)
      #:|end-loop-693| (RETURN-FROM NIL NIL)))))

In the Win32 expansion, the declared type of X is (or null int-pair)
which, of course, (load-time-value 'nil) satisfies. Is this a bug? I
would have expected the same macroexpansion for the same loop on
multiple supported platforms.  I think I like the second expansion
better, since without any information about what kind of value the
loop will default X to, it's impossible to write an appropriate type
declaration for it.  It seems like the code that produces the
initialization code should be the code that wraps any provided
typespec in (or appropriate-typespec user-typespec).

Thoughts? Thanks in advance,

[1] I think the following says that the loop variables can be
initialized to any value. "The for and as clauses iterate by using one
or more local loop variables that are initialized to some value and
that can be modified or stepped[1] after each iteration. For these
clauses, iteration terminates when a local variable reaches some
supplied value or when some other loop clause terminates iteration. At
each iteration, variables can be stepped[1] by an increment or a
decrement or can be assigned a new value by the evaluation of a form).
Destructuring can be used to assign values to variables during
iteration." (http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/06_aba.htm).

However, variables bound with WITH are a bit different: "The with
construct initializes variables that are local to a loop. The
variables are initialized one time only. If the optional type-spec
argument is supplied for the variable var, but there is no related
expression to be evaluated, var is initialized to an appropriate
default value for its type. For example, for the types t, number, and
float, the default values are nil, 0, and 0.0 respectively."
(http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/06_abb.htm) If
I understand the LOOP grammar correctly, the type can be any type
specifier, but it would seem odd to require an implementation to be
able to come up with some default value for every type.
