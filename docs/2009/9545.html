                <h1>FILE-POSITION for TCP stream</h1>
                <pre>
I want to display a progress bar showing what proportion of a lump of 
data has been received via a stream created using COMM:OPEN-TCP-STREAM.

I can arrange to be sent the size of the data before it is sent, but is 
there a way to find how much data has been received at a given time?  (I 
want something like CL:FILE-POSITION, which, as far as I can see, always 
returns NIL for TCP streams.)

You could use the positions of flexi streams for this.
