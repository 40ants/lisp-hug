                <h1>CLOS object finalization</h1>
                <pre>
Dear everyone,

I am encapsulating foreign allocated objects within CLOS classes.  
In  my case, it is okay to free the memory when the garbage collector 
reclaims the objects.  So here is how I am finalizing my CLOS objects:


(defgeneric finalize-object (object)
  (:method (object)
    (declare (ignore object))
    nil))

(hcl:add-special-free-action 'finalize-object)


(defclass my-class ()
  ())

(defmethod initialize-instance :after ((self my-class) &amp;key)
  (hcl:flag-special-free-action self))

(defmethod finalize-object ((self my-class))
  ;; Do whatever is needed to finalize the object here ...
  ;; Warning: the thread in which this code is called is unknown.
  ...)


FLI users: and you, how do you do this?
Do you have a different technique?
Are there any pitfalls I have missed?

I  search  for  something  already existing in LW, but I did not find 
anything  similar.  I thought the problem wasn't so specific ...


Cheers,
Camille

Hi Camille,

The RDNZL code also includes examples of this technique - pretty
similar to what you are doing.

Cheers,
Edi.
