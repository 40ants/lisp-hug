                <pre>
Is there any recorded history of the LW IDE, and influences on it?  I can remember seeing a Harlequin Lisp environment in (I think) 1989, but I don't remember if that was anything like the current environment and in fact I don't know if it was a direct ancestor of LW.

Slightly related: I once thought that the editor had common heritage with Hemlock (whose heritage I don't actually know other than that it came with CMUCL, so perhaps from Spice Lisp): is that actually true or is it a completely independent thing.

This is just personal curiosity.

As long as where walking down memory lane: what became of the MLWorks
environment Harlequin once distributed in beta test? It was a remarkably
nice way to work with a *ML type language.

&gt I believe LispWorks is indeed descended from Harlequin - in fact the HCL package refers to Harlequin Common Lisp. I've never heard anything about a connection to
&gt Hemlock, though.
&gt
&gt There's also this, which I find intriguing...

I asked Martin Simmons about this once:

&gt&gt&gt PS. Congratulations on the release of LispWorks 6! I am very happy
&gt&gt&gt with the new features (and I have not had the time to look at all of
&gt&gt&gt them. And where is the Harlequin? :-)

&gt Thanks!  And congratulates on reading the release notes so thoroughly
&gt :-) 
&gt
&gt The Debug toolbar button design (Listener, Process Browser) is a
&gt Harlequin ladybird.  These are now common in parts of England, and
&gt apparantly have also reached South Africa:

The main thing I recall was in Interlisp - the stack was a first class object (so you could capture the state of your program in a variable for backtracking purposes - like a dynamic closure, but without the limitations - more like a continuation). And using the editor meant you couldn't do conditional compilation - we dropped the D machines for Lisp at U Rochester when we needed to write portable code. (That is, no way to do #+foo since that's outside your parens). Since we had a mixed unix (franz), symbolics, dandylion environment, the d machines were the 'most different' and fell into disuse. (I think there was a group that continued to use Mesa for some years though).

&gt 
&gt Well, my memory is now fading since, like you, I've not used a D machines for more than 20 years, but I think the way it reminds me of them is that it's a lots-of-little-windows environment (ie listener, editor, inspector, system browser &amp;c &amp;c), together with the ability to make your own tools in an incredibly lightweight way -- I'm still in the process of reviving various things I had from old CVS repositories, but it's terribly easy to create little visualisation tools based on the grapher, and I used to have lots of such things, as well as others I'd make on the fly via CAPI:CONTAIN.
&gt 
&gt Obviously it differs in that it look after source as text files with an emacsy editor rather than as structures in memory with a structure editor, and that's a pretty profound difference.
&gt 
&gt But compared to the MIT-family environments it's also very different.  I don't know how it compares with other modern non-Lisp IDEs - I have only really used Eclipse and LW just grinds that into dust, for me.
