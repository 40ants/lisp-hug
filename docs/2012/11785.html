                <h1>Using CAPI:tree-view without affecting display</h1>
                <pre>
I am displaying a tree-view and search it for items.  In order to find 
whether the item is in one of the children, I initially completely 
expand and collapse the tree so that CAPI becomes aware of all the items 
in the tree.

I would rather that the expanding and collapsing not be visible to the 
user.  Is there a way to do this "behind-the-scenes"?  Do I need to make 
a shadow tree-view and how would I do that so it isn't visible? Or do I 
need to create a new structure which represents the items and their 
position in the tree?

Mitch

Can you not create a structure for your fully-expanded data and then just have a tree-view which just walks that structure?
