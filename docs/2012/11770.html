&gt While I've been programming Lisp for quite some time (hobbyist), I've never done "full" development of something major. Perhaps the above question is rendered moot by just saving an image or using quicklisp, etc, but ATM I'm hoping there's just a simple thing like:

&gt (push #p"~/Projects/lisp-stuff/" *load-paths*)

My advice is that you should just go for quicklisp. Assuming that you have created asdf definitions for your own code, compiling/loading a module is as simple as 

(ql:quickload :my-project)

As a bonus, quicklisp will also pull in all of your dependencies for you, and if there are dependencies that quicklisp does not know about, you can add these manually into a place where quicklisp will find them (the same place that you'll have to place your own code - ~/quicklisp/local-projects).

Maybe lw:current-pathname can fit. (If *load-pathname* is not enough.)

I don't think LW has anything by default.  I mostly agree with whoever said "use Quicklisp": it really is the answer to this I think.

However I have some stuff which lets you install things in one or more directory trees and then provides a wrapper around require which will search for them.  It assumes you use structured module names (though if they're flat it will work, they just will all end up in a smaller subset of directories).

A version of this lives here: http://www.tfeb.org/lisp/implementation-hax.html, but it looks as if it's out of date.  If you are interested I will merge across the current version.  It's all quite old now, and is historically entangled with a bunch of other stuff (defining new colon commands in LW, and the definition of some that I used), but it could be extracted if you wanted it standalone, perhaps.

--tim

So, for instance, at the command level (and with verbosity cranked up):

CL-USER 3 &gt :require "ORG.TFEB.HAX.COLLECTING" :pretend t :verbose t
