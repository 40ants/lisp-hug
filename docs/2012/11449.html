Thats perhaps not of much help to you, but on Mac OS X there is the "ODB Editor Protocol" which enables Editors to get integrated into other programs speaking that protocol (e. g. Xcode).

I would recommend one of the two possibilities.

1. As you want two different applications running in parallel and you are on
Windows, you can use DDE API. Please take a look at
examples/dde/lispwork-ide.lisp.

2. You could embed the LispWorks Editor just into your small program.
Edi Weitz's editor.lisp is a good starting point. As an example of such a
small application, please take a look at
http://lisp.ystok.ru/ru/yhelp/
This is an open source HTML help compiler, with a "help book" definition
based on ASDF syntax. (Unfortunately, only the Russian version is available
at moment.)

I had something which did this among other things: it was called "clc" - common lisp client unofficially - and there was a little client (actually a delivered LW image) which could send arbitrary commands to a server.  On the server side (the server being typically just the IDE) you could write handlers for commands.  So it worked like one of the "wrapper command [args]"-style interfaces which are quite common now (svn, p4 and so on are all like this among many others).  So, for instance "clc edit /path/to/file".  It ran anywhere LW did.  I don't remember if there was an edit-a-file command in it, but it would not be hard to implement one (and I think there probably was).

The reason it probably is not interesting is that it used CORBA, so required LW enterprise.

I am intending to revive something like clc but not using CORBA as I don't have an LWE license now (also CORBA is horrid), but it might take a long time for me to get around to it.

I can probably make the source to clc available (I am sure it is shareable &amp; I still have it, it's a matter of finding it and extracting it from an old CVS repository and disentangling it from the possibly-non-shareable code surrounding it).  That also will probably take ages.  Let me know if you would still be interested.
