PAPER SUBMISSION DEADLINE EXTENDED 


European Lisp Symposium 2012, Zadar, Croatia, April 30th - May 1st, 2012 

http://european-lisp-symposium.org 

The purpose of the European Lisp Symposium is to provide a forum for 
the discussion and dissemination of all aspects of design, 
implementation and application of any of the Lisp and Lisp-inspired 
dialects, including Common Lisp, Scheme, Emacs Lisp, AutoLisp, ISLISP, 
Dylan, Clojure, ACL2, ECMAScript, Racket, SKILL, and so on. We 
encourage everyone interested in Lisp to participate. 


The main theme of the 2012 European Lisp Conference is 
"Interoperability: Systems, Libraries, Workflows".  Lisp based and 
functional-languages based systems have grown a variety of solutions 
to become more and more integrated with the wider world of Information 
and Communication Technologies in current use.  There are several 
dimensions to the scope of the solutions proposed, ranging from 
"embedding" of interpreters in C-based systems, to the development of 
abstractions levels that facilitate the expression of complex context 
dependent tasks, to the construction of exchange formats handling 
libraries, to the construction of theorem-provers for the "Semantic 
Web".  The European Lisp Symposium 2012 solicits the submission of 
papers with this specific theme in mind, alongside the more 
traditional tracks which have appeared in the past editions. 

We invite submissions in the following forms: 

Papers: Technical papers of up to 15 pages that describe original 
results or explain known ideas in new and elegant ways. 

Demonstrations: Abstracts of up to 4 pages for demonstrations of 
tools, libraries, and applications. 

Tutorials: Abstracts of up to 4 pages for in-depth presentations about 
topics of special interest for at least 90 minutes and up to 180 
minutes. 

Lightning talks: Abstracts of up to one page for talks to last for no 
more than 5 minutes. 

All submissions should be formatted following the ACM SIGS guidelines 
and include ACM classification categories and terms. For more 
information on the submission guidelines and the ACM keywords, see: 
http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates and 
http://www.acm.org/about/class/1998. 


Important dates: 

February 15th 2012: submission deadline (extended deadline) 
March 7th 2012: acceptance results 

April 30th 2012: Conference opens
