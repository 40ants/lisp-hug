Theorically, it would be possible to create threads and load different
files at the same time.

In practice, AFAIK, MK:DEFSYSTEM and ASDF don't parallelize loading.  
I don't know about XCVB either, but perhaps it could be more easily be
made to load files in parallel, from its design.

Furthermore, most implementations have locks to prevent problems when
defining things in parallel (which should not be too often a problem,
assuming you don't load the same file twice at the same time, but
sometimes those locks are quite coarse (eg. sbcl).


I don't know if lispworks lock is coarse or not.  If it is not, then you
could write a load script to load several files at once.  The question
then is for you to know the dependencies between your files, and whether
you have groups of files that can be loaded at the same time (not
depending one on the other).

If it takes 3 days then there must be some pretty extensive load-time computation going on (it can't just be a bunch of straightforward of definitions if it takes that long).  So I think the thing to do would be to understand where that is happening, and what its dependencies look like, and then to modify the thing to push that out into multiple processes, which can then run in parallel, using some kind of queue which will run up to n threads at once to keep the machine busy.
