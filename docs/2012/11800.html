I believe many of the Russians miss KOI8-R, the most popular encoding
of Russian on *nix.

Edi's flexi-streams supports CP850, KOI8-R, and almost every encoding
one could wish. It is quite universal but is not very efficient IMHO.

FLEXI-STREAMS doesn't directly support the Lotus Notes external
format, but it should be fairly easy to add that.

It is indeed true that FLEXI-STREAMS - because it tries to be flexible
and to work across many different Lisps - isn't very efficient
compared to native implementations.  The 1.0.x versions are a lot
faster than older releases, though.

Cheers,
Edi.
