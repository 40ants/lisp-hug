                <h1>accessing a stream's file descriptors</h1>
                <pre>

  Hello,

I need to access the output file descriptor of a stream (so that I can
pass it to a CFFI foreign function. Allegro has
excl::stream-output-handle and CLISP has ext:stream-handles for
instance. What is the equivalent in Lispworks?

thank you!

  Thanks Nick (for the two colons ;-). But that does not always work. In
particular, this function won't accept a SYSTEM::TERMINAL-STREAM which
is what I get when using *STANDARD-OUTPUT* (with some bits of
canonicalization).

&gt I don't think all streams even have file descriptors.

  Yeah, that's true. It seems to me that TERMINAL-STREAMs should,
though. As per Paul's suggestion, I introspected a bit and the only
thing I could see so far is a slot named OUTPUT-HANDLE which sounds
kinda nice, but its value for *terminal-io* is T, not an fd... :-/


&gt On the mac implementation there's a class
&gt stream::os-file-handle-stream, and I guess those are the ones that
&gt correspond to filehandles in the underlying system.

  Probably (hence Nick's suggestion). However, even in a standalone
console application (delivered from Lispworks), a TERMINAL-STREAM such
as *terminal-io* has no relation with an OS stream, and that currently
escapes me...

  Hmmm, so is this a singleton?


&gt (but note that output to *TERMINAL-IO* will not be written there by
&gt default in a GUI application).

  Is there a way to know where it will be printed ?


&gt What will be the foreign code do with the fd?

  Perform an ioctl on it.


&gt Is this code supposed to work on Windows?

  Err, not sure :-) In fact, I think it should under cygwin, but
probably not otherwise.

&gt
&gt That could be risky on a file descriptor that you don't control (and could be
&gt of an unknown type, e.g. pipe, tty).  Which ioctl is it?  Possibly LispWorks
&gt should include an API for it?

  TIOCGWINSZ. It's for Clon. The idea is to figure out whether the
stream is connected to a terminal and (when that's the case) get the
terminal size at the same time.

The most common situation is a standalone application doing 'app --help'
or 'app --help &gt file' on a terminal (which involves *standard-output*
in both cases).

In case you're interested, I'm attaching the file doing this in the
current version of Clon. It supports 7 implementations in various ways
(CFFI or some implementation-specific version). The current code would
probably break for esoteric streams (checking slime streams is on my
TODO List) but it works for the intended usage at least.

  FWIW, here's a new version with more robust support for non
FILE-STREAMs and with support for Lispworks SYSTEM::TERMINAL-STREAMs as
well...
