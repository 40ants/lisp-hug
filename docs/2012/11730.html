I'm on Linux Mint (previously Mandriva) and Windows.

&gt
ALT-TAB

^X^O switches between editor windows (only).

&gt

I get one by default.

How are you starting LWL?

&gt Is there a document that describes the differences between using the 
&gt IDE on Unix and other OSes?
I don't know of one that explicitly addresses differences.  I find that 
all of the keystrokes I expect to work, do.  Probably because Windows 
and Linux are more similar than OS X.

I'd be glad to answer more such questions...

The IDE provides a function "Invoke Tool", which seems to be bound to
C-# on GTK on lw601 personal
&lt;http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw61/IDE-M/html/ide-m-28.htm&gt

[But there are other usability issues that interfere with this (and
 other menu accelerators when using the keyboard), on LW/GTK, with both
 emacs and windows bindings.]

The echo-podium comes up by default: Isn't this what you are referring
to ?

(capi:display (capi:find-interface 'lw-tools:lispworks-echo-podium))
