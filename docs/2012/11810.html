Hi Nick,

This may not be suited to your need if your process must be stopped in the middle of some processing.
I send a message to the process' mailbox, and use process-join to wait for the process to finish gracefully.  I have very good results with this approach.


Best,
Cam

&gt  (unless (eq thread (mp:get-current-process))
&gt    (mp:process-stop thread)
&gt    (mp:process-wait "Waiting for other thread to stop"

&gt                     thread)))
&gt 
&gt Sometimes this works really smoothly. But sometimes it takes a second
&gt or two. I wrapped some timing code around the wait function; it
&gt appears that the wait function is called a couple of times in the
&gt first millisecond and then not again for up to several hundred
&gt milliseconds.
&gt 
&gt If I were waiting for anything other than a process-stop I could use
&gt process-wait-local and process-poke. Obviously I can't use these here.
&gt 
&gt So what should I do?
