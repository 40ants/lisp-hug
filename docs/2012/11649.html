<div dir="ltr">Hi Lispers,<br><br>I have a display-callback which calls some Sqlite functions via the FLI - specifically <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/blob_open.html">sqlite3_blob_open</a> and <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/blob_reopen.html">sqlite3_blob_reopen</a>, from the Sqlite incremental I/O API.

What (extended) error codes are returned by sqlite?  Does it work from
inside the callbacks when you use open/close instead of reopen?

&gt It will work, however, if I pass it to mp:process-run-function
&gt within the callback.  This suggests that there is some kind of
&gt threading issue occurring (though Sqlite is thread-safe).

I assume you're not setting any threading-related options via
sqlite3_config. Did you confirm thread-safety by checking the return
value of sqlite3_threadsafe?

&gt Perhaps it's something relating to the thread that the callback runs
&gt in - my assumption was that this would just be the same thread as
&gt the CAPI window, but perhaps that's not right.

As far as I know, CAPI callbacks do indeed always run in the process
of the toplevel interface.

&gt This behaviour seems rather odd, and not the kind of thing I would
&gt expect to happen when interfacing with Sqlite, which is normally
&gt extremely robust. Before I head over to the Sqlite list I thought

Wish I could offer some insight.  My own use of sqlite has been
largely problem-free, although I use a pool of dedicated workers to
handle database tasks, and a buffered-stream wrapper for blob I/O.

Even if the issue you're experiencing is resolved, I'd still suggest
using a separate process to interact with the database instead of from
directly inside UI callbacks (especially since you already said that
that works).
