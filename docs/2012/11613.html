                <pre>
I seem to have found a bug in LW-6.0 (Personal Edition), however I am
reluctant to file a report since LW-6.1 Personal Edition has not been
released yet. For my own purposes I'd like to know if it's been fixed.

The RUN function below eventually hangs on my Linux machine, typically
within 100 to 3000 iterations. I am certain it's not due to the
Personal Edition memory limit since I can interrupt (SLIME C-c-c)
after the hang occurs and re-run it.

(defun test (thread-count)
  (let ((from-threads (mp:make-semaphore))
        (to-threads   (mp:make-semaphore)))
    (loop repeat thread-count
       do (mp:process-run-function
           "test" nil (lambda ()
                        (mp:semaphore-acquire to-threads)
                        (mp:semaphore-release from-threads))))
    (loop repeat thread-count
       do (mp:semaphore-release to-threads))
    (loop repeat thread-count
       do (mp:semaphore-acquire from-threads))))

(defun run ()
  (loop
     (test 16)
     (format t ".")))


* It does not hang when a semaphore is removed.

* The probability of hanging increases as thread-count increases.

* Also hangs when semaphores are replaced with blocking queues
  implemented with condition variables.

* Also hangs when the FORMAT call is removed.

I can confirm this bug does not exist under LW 6.1 on OS X.   The test below runs indefinitely without hanging even with high thread counts as high as 128.

LW6.1 on Linux works normal as well, but LW6.0 Linux enterprise fails really hard...

I have similar test with 2 semaphores which emulate MVar and it behaves the same way as this test.

I can't repeat the hanging with the condition variable implementation in
LispWorks 6.0 either.

Are you writing to confirm that it was fixed in one of the 6.0
patches, or are you looking to reproduce the hang? If the latter then
run

lispworks-personal-6-0-1-x86-linux, md5 0f836edc2f40485ffb07224485bf44e3

You need to compile the example. I just tried interpreted mode and did
not see a hang.

I've managed to repeat it now.  The bug that causes condition variables to
hang under stress is fixed in LispWorks 6.1 too.
