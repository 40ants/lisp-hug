                <h1>Hash character on UK mac keyboards (LW 6.1)</h1>
                <pre>
[Sorry if this is a duplicate: I sent a previous version from, I think, the wrong account: it's not shown up anyway.]

Has anyone dealt with this problem?  I want to use LW with the alt key being meta (as that's what Emacs does on the mac, and I've weaned myself off XEmacs now which had command as meta).  But I have a UK keyboard and the stantard way to get a hash character is alt-3.

What I've done based on some very slight reading of the editor sources is

(in-package "EDITOR")

(defcommand "Insert Hash" (n)
    "Insert hash character"
    "Insert hash character"
 (loop repeat (or n 1)
       do (insert-character (current-point) #\#)))

(bind-key "Insert Hash"
         #\meta-£)

Which makes alt-shift-3 insert a hash (and obviously one cold steal meta-3 but that's already used as a prefix).

Is there something better than this (short of command-is-meta)?

Thanks
