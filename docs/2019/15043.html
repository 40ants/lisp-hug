I've seen reports on Twitter that 64 bit LW runs fine on Catalina.

I wasn't even aware that it was possible to run 32 bit LispWorks on
recent MacOS versions for the last few years! I started delivering our
PrimeTrader application with 64-bit LW exclusively in 2011.

1. 32 bit LW runs on all other platforms making development on those platforms almost 2x less expensive than on Mac OS (if you do not need 64 bits)

                 <pre>You are correct, but you should be blaming Apple instead.

This looks to me more like a pricing concern than a compatibility one. I do not
like paying twice the amount for 64bit support either but it is what it is.

For me the real question is what will happen with the Personal Edition, which I
do not use nor recommend to anyone anyway.

                 <pre>It runs basically, but I would expect glitches. The OS is very new and with complex changes... like changed filesystem access rules.
Unless one tested it more deeply and the application code one is writing, I would be careful...

Why is that, Eric?&nbsp; It's annoying that it doesn't support autoloading

it's far friendlier for beginners on MacOS (the majority of my students)

                 <h1>Re: MacOS Catalina</h1>
                 <pre>Hi Christopher,

I say that because while I consider the Personal Edition to be a good and
friction-less introduction to Common Lisp, specially compared to the open source
alternatives (which is something that should appeal to you and your students),
it is not a good representation of what a paid LispWorks product has to offer.

My experience is that you cannot write non trivial programs with the PE without
it crashing either due to the limited heap size or a bug that is already fixed
in newer versions. Examples in the Common Lisp Cookbook and Edi's book either
crash or fail to load, while they do work on LispWorks 7. Trying out CAPI (which
is one of the biggest selling points for LW) on recent macOS versions still
renders those large vertical margins around buttons and makes applications look
ugly. Other little things that make a significant difference such as syntax
highlighting in the listener are missing as well. The lack of polish compared to
the latest versions is there and it makes for a flawed introduction to such an
amazing IDE.

You may argue that this is not the role of the PE, and that someone interested
in purchasing a license should instead ask for an evaluation license straight
away, but in my experience this is often not the case and the PE is instead the
usual entry point.

Hence my comment in the former mail.

&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt&gt MacOS Catalina is now available, and with Catalina it is no longer possible to
&gt&gt&gt&gt run 32-bit applications. Will there be a new release of Lispworks that will
&gt&gt&gt&gt run under Catalina?
