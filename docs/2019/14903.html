                <h1>Re-evaluating last form on MacOS</h1>
                <pre>Hi Lispworks HUG,

I’m just getting started, and running through some of the tutorials [1], on MacOS Mojave and Lispworks 7.1.1.

In the listener window I’m having an issue using Meta+P to fill in the previous form(s).  When I use Meta-P (Option-P), it’s simply printing a greek pi character, and with shift an uppercase pi.  I’m not sure if this happening because of keyboard input at the OS level or something in Lispworks.  Is there a way for me to remap this action to Meta-Up?  Or any other ideas?

Cheers,
Steve

                 <pre>What is your meta key?  Are you using a Mac keyboard?

I’m using an old keyboard.  I get a Pi if I hit ALT-P.

I’ve told my mixintosh to bind CAPS-LOCK to "^ CONTROL”.  When I hit CAPS-LOCK-P, I get the previous line. (Mac Apple&gt&gtSystem Preferences&gt&gtKeyboard&gt&gtModifier Keys).

I *think* that LWM (LispWorks Macintosh) comes with two sets of bindings (Emacs and Apple).  YMMV.

I’m really a linux user - if anybody has better suggestions for how to bind the keyboard (IBM Model M) on a Mac better, do let me know.

                 <pre>Select Preferences in the LispWorks menu. Choose "Environment", the click on the Emulation tab. Select

- Editor keys are like Mac OS X editors

- The Alt key acts as the Emacs Meta key

                 <pre>Thanks Paul, that was helpful and pointed me in the right direction.  In the Environment-&gtEmulation preferences, I kept the default setting of Emacs keys, but changes the Meta key option from “There is no Emacs Meta Key” to “The Alt Key acts as the Emacs Meta Key” and Meta (the Option key on newer Mac keyboards) is working as expected to scroll back through previously entered forms.

Much thanks!

Steve

                 <pre>Hi,

To rebind these commands add you your config file something like

;; Bind Ctrl-Up/Down to previous/next commands in Listener
(editor:bind-key "History Next" "Control-Down" :mode "Execute")
(editor:bind-key "History Previous" "Control-Up" :mode "Execute")
;; Same for Cmd-UP/Down 
(editor:bind-key "History Next" "Hyper-Down" :mode "Execute")
(editor:bind-key "History Previous" "Hyper-Up" :mode "Execute")
