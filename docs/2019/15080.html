                <h1>Open GL Support</h1>
                <pre>Hi Lispworks Hug,

I’m in the process of updating an older lispworks project from 2014-ish.

It uses OpenGL, and it looks like there is no longer opengl support in lispworks, or at least I don’t see it in the current docs.

An excerpt from the doc.txt file from the `opengl` directory that was copied in to the project:

```txt
;; -*- Mode: Text; rcs-header: "$Header: /hope/lwhope1-cam/hope.0/compound/61/LISPopengl/RCS/doc.txt,v 1.7.1.1 2006/03/24 14:46:33 davef Exp $" -*-

LispWorks OpenGL interface
--------------------------


The lispworks library directory examples/opengl contains source code
for a Lisp interface to the OpenGL libraries.

You can use CAPI output-panes as OpenGL windows.  


Installation
------------

To install, copy the entire directory to a working directory of your
own, load the host.lisp file, then evaluate (load "OPENGL:compile").
This will compile all the files needed for the CAPI interface.
```

I’m running into some errors trying to compile it with the directions there, but before I dig in to too much further, I’m wondering if there is an updated copy of the OpenGL support I should be using for development on MacOS with Lispworks 7.1

Cheers,
Steve

                 <pre>Hi again,

I just wanted to check again to see if anyone knows what happened to, and if it still exists, the OpenGL CAPI widget that was around for Lispworks 6.1 from the mid 2000’s. 

Cheers,
Steve

(load "path/to/opengl/examples/load")

(setf v (capi:display (make-instance 'icosahedron-viewer)))

                 <pre>Thanks John and Priyadarshan!!

I managed to find and get the demos working on LispWorks 7.1 on MacOS.  Works great, cheers!
