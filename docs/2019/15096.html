                <h1>reset LWM?</h1>
                <pre>Is there a way to reset LWM to its virgin (ground) state?

Throw away all packages, defuns, defmethods, declasses, etc.

It takes longer to start a new LW image than it takes to load and compile files.  If I could simply reset LWM, then re-load-compile my files, I would be a happier person.

                 <pre>Effectively you’d be inventing your own version of LW’s deliver function. 

Walk all your packages, undefining every function, method, class, etc. Unintern every symbol and delete the packages. Did that not work? Walk the Lisp looking for interlopers. 

In the mid 90s a colleague at Harlequin and I spent three months improving LW’s delivery. The above is basically how we went about it.

&gt How long does it take?  On my 2013 mac it takes something under a second to start LW once things are warmed up.

&gt 

It takes almost no time to start LW (maybe a second or two on my mac).  (And it takes even less time to compile/load a file.)

I'm debugging the alpha of an app that is built in layers (not using a “standard" Lisp workflow) and I'm relying on LW's warnings to tell me what is yet undefined.

CL is loaded with features to help with developer turn-around.  I was thinking that maybe I've missed some feature that would help me at this very moment.
