                <h1>Encoding error when trying to quickload library with LispWorks (fails to 
                 detect UTF-8)</h1>
                <pre>Hi!

#|
  This is my first post in the mailing list, so first I'd like to introduce
  myself: I'm Eric, I work as a DevOps engineer and although during my career I
  have been mostly using Perl, Go and OCaml, just recently I resumed my interest
  with Common Lisp and finding it really enjoyable so far.

I am writing a project which uses the following library as a dependency:

https://github.com/Shinmera/plump

It works out of the box when using SBCL and CCL, but when trying to use it with
LispWorks I get the following error(s):

  **++++ Error between functions:
    Cannot read character U+008C as part of a token because it has constituent
    trait 'invalid'.


I am using LispWorks 7.1.2 on macOS, with the bundled ASDF (3.3.0, which should
use UTF-8 as default encoding) and an up-to-date Quicklisp client (2019-02-16).


This is puzzling to me as compiling the buffer from inside the IDE works fine (I
have the file encoding set to UTF-8). #'compile-file fails, but specifying the
encoding solves the issue:

  (compile-file "entities.lisp" :external-format :utf-8)

However, the problems persists when trying to quickload the library, even when
ASDF is detecting the right encoding:

  (uiop/stream:detect-encoding "entities.lisp")
  ;=&gt :UTF-8

Adding :encoding :utf-8 when specifying the components on ASDF doesn't have any
effect either.

I have found so far two ways to work around this:

1) Add -*- coding: utf-8 -*- at the beginning of the file. It feels like a hack
   and the library author seems to be adamant about merging such patch.

2) Loading https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/asdf/asdf-encodings which for some
   reason solves all issues and I don't understand why, because if I got it
   right, its goal is to add support for encodings other than UTF-8.

So I am not happy with the former nor I understand the latter, and it would be
great if some of you that had a similar issue could shed some light on it or
offer an alternative solution.

Some additional context here: https://github.com/Shinmera/plump/pull/23

Thanks,

Eric

                 <pre>Hi Eric,

When you start LispWorks and before you load anything what is the value of lw:*default-character-element-type*?

If not character, try this before loading your system:

(lw:set-default-character-element-type 'character)

                 <pre>Hi Martin &amp; John,

After doing

  (pushnew :asdf-unicode features)

the library now loads without requiring any additional changes to it. Great!


And doing

  (lw:set-default-character-element-type 'character)

also fixed the following issue I encountered while parsing HTML content:

  Error: #\â€“ (of type CHARACTER) is not of type BASE-CHAR.


Thanks again,

Eric
