                <h1>A lazy question: Quicklisp &amp; ASDF on LW 7.1</h1>
                <pre>Does anyone have a set of instructions for making this work from a cold LW image?  LW 7.1, 64-bit, OSX.

I have done this previously (but perhaps not for 7.1).  I think the problem that you have to work around is to make it be the case that the version of ASDF that things find, both at QL install time and then also later is the one that QL wants.

I can easily get to the point where QL 'works' in the sense that it's all downloaded and the .../setup.lisp file loads fine, but if I then try and actually load packages I immediately get problems which smell like ASDF version skew (the actual errors come from make-instance but they are clearly trying to make things in the guts of ASDF).

It just might be that the problem is in my init files, which might be doing something which causes ASDF to get dragged in too early, thus picking up the LW one (or my dumped image may already have it, but I don't thinks so: if I run lw and/or lw -init - I get:

CL-USER 1 &gt (apropos "ASDF")
*autoload-asdf-integration*, value: t
:asdf-uppercase, value: :asdf-uppercase
:asdf, value: :asdf

(in both cases before I have installed QL).

I can investigate that but I thought I would ask the lazy question first.

Thanks
