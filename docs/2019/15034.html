                <h1>foreign-parser</h1>
                <pre>First time trying to use foreign-parser. I want to build an interface to 
a lame3 DLL with 64-bit lispworks.

the lame.h file starts with (comments deleted for simplicity)
#include &lt;stddef.h&gt
#include &lt;stdarg.h&gt

I'm trying to get started with just these in, say, test.h.

It seems these headers are found is many places,

#P"C:/Program Files (x86)/Windows Kits/10/include/*/ucrt" apparently for 
various version of the libraries.

Straight way stddef.h references &lt;vcruntime.h&gt which is found in

[c:\program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 
14.0\VC\include\vcruntime.h:210]: Warning: Unexpected symbol "__vcrt_bool".

I have not programmed in C for at least a decade. I suspect the Visual 
Studio system supplied some needed definitions prior to working on user 
code.

Anyone else here trudged down this path before that could give me a clue?

Paul

                 <h1>Re: foreign-parser</h1>
                 <pre>Turns out that only a couple of OS specific definitions are needed for 
this .h file. I made a wild guess as to the values and am able to 
continue on. I actually have called into the init function and got back 
a pointer to some hidden structure. So far, so good.
