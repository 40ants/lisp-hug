                <pre>
  Hello,

two questions on CAPI geometry management:

1. I have a column layout with two radio button panels inside. They both
have titles with :title-position :frame. On Cocoa, this gives the panels
a darker grey background, and it becomes noticeable that they do not
have the same width. I would like to make them the same width (in fact,
the width of the layout itself which is probably that of the widest
panel inside). Is that possible?

2. I have an output pane on which I draw stuff manually. The pane is
scrollable in both directions. I need to dynamically change the pane's
internal geometry (regardless of the size of the visible portion) from
time to time. I can't figure out how to do that from the docs.

Thanks!

You can create both panels with :visible-max-width nil, that will make them fill out the space. However it may also make them ”unnecessary” wide, so you may want to limit the max-width of the column/interface.

(capi:set-horizontal-scroll-parameters pane :max-range new-internal-width :slug-position … )
(capi:set-vertical-scroll-parameters pane :max-range new-internal-height :slug-position …)
