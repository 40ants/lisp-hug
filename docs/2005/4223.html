The capi ref for class button says

:callback 
Called when the button is pressed.

:selection-callback 
Called when the button is selected.

:retract-callback 
Called when the button is deselected.

Looks to me like you want :callback.

I know this is probably not related to your question, but isn't using
#.*standard-output* in this way a very dangerous thing to do?

The stream that *standard-output* is bound to at read-time may not
even exist at load-time, I would think.  Or it may exist in your
development image but not in a delivered application.

Or am I missing something?
