                <h1>Right-click in list panels</h1>
                <pre>There are many tools in the LW IDE (for example the "Functions" tab in
a class browser) that upon inspection seem to be list panels and that
show a popup menu if one right-clicks an entry.

Is there a way to do the same thing in user code, i.e. to add
callbacks for right clicks on list panels?

Thanks,
Edi.

Great, that works!  Thanks, Nick.

Now, do you also happen to know how one can easily translate the X/Y
coordinates (LOCAL seems to be always NIL in my case) to the list
panel item that's below the mouse?  I rummaged around a bit but can't
seem to find anything.

Thanks again,
Edi.

&gt I got around this by having my menu act on the current

Ah, yes, that didn't occur to me.  I wanted to reply that this
technique doesn't really give me the item I right-clicked on but I
checked again and this seems to be consistent with how the LW IDE
behaves.  So at least they don't have some secret potion... :)

Thanks a lot,
Edi.
