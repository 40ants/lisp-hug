                <h1>Scrolling an editor pane during create callback</h1>
                <pre>Hi!

If you compile the code below and execute (FOO) you'll get an editor
pane with two push buttons.  If you press UP the editor will scroll to
the start of the text, if you press DOWN, the editor will scroll to
the end of the text.  Fine.

However, note that there's a call to DOWN in the create callback of
the interface.  This one doesn't seem to have any effect.  I tried
several other strategies but without success.  What I want is to
programmatically set the scrolling position of an editor pane to a
certain position at the very moment when it's displayed.

Is there a way to do that?

Thanks,
Edi.

I think the problem might be related to the editor input style that  
ensures the point is always visible [try (apropos "always-visible")  
for some references]. I have that off on the Mac and your window  
opens with the text scrolled to the bottom.

Other than changing the input style, one possible fix might be to  
make sure you move the (editor:current-point) for the buffer rather  
than just a temporary point as you have done in the adjust-scrollbar  
function.

Best,

This works for me (LWW 4.3.7). I don't notice any flicker.

(defun foo ()

Hmm, somehow it doesn't feel right.  If you change the create callback
to look like this, for example,

  (lambda (interface)
    (sleep 1)
    (setf (capi:editor-pane-text (editor interface))
           (coerce
            (loop for i below *size*
                  collect (code-char (+ #.(char-code #\A)
                                        (mod i 26))))
            'string)))

then it ceases to work so in a way it only works "by accident."

More importantly, your approach doesn't work in my actual application
which is a lot more complicated than my silly little example.  I'll
try to come up with a better example.

Thanks,
Edi.

With your change above, the following works for me:

(defun foo ()
  (let ((interface (make-instance 'foo-interface)))
    (capi:display interface)
    (mp:process-allow-scheduling)
    (down (editor interface))))


Do you think the last line should use apply-in-pane-process?

    (capi:apply-in-pane-process (editor interface)
                                (lambda ()
                                  (down (editor interface))))))

What is the difference between mp:process-allow-scheduling and mp:yield?
mp:yield did not work for me.

After I STFE (sent the email) I RTFM page on mp:yield more carefully than I
did the first time. 

"Normally code compiled at safety 0 cannot be preempted because the necessary
checks are ommited. This can be overcome by calling yield  at regular
intervals. Usually there is no need to call this if you use functions from
the common-lisp package because these are not compiled at safety 0, but for
example if you find that preemption is not working in a loop with no function
calls, yield  can be useful. Note that process-allow-scheduling  also allows
preemption, but also checks the wait functions of other processes."

LWW uses native threads, so why are any checks necessary? Can't native
threads always be preempted? If so, are the checks discussed above there only
for e.g. LWL, non-native-thread implementations? 

Process-allow-scheduling checks 'other processes'. Is that sentence using
'process' as a synonym for 'thread' (e.g. mp -- multiprocessing)? If mp:yield
doesn't check other threads, is the doc saying that mp:yield yields to its
own thread? What would that even mean?

Yep.  But (see other message) why does this make a difference at all

I think so, yes.

My best guess is a race condition, which is why I tried mp:yield and friends.
My hypothesis is that capi:display scrolls editor panes to the top after the
pane's :create-callback has been called. In foo, capi:display creates a
second process and returns. The race is between foo trying to (down (editor
interface)) and capi:display trying to do it's version of (up (editor
interface)). 

I think it's not a bug in that inter-process coordination is always a
problem. To really solve it, one would need to have a callback or other
synchronization method provided by capi:display, called or triggered after
all work, including scrolling editor panes to the top, had been performed.

....
&gt PS: This doesn't solve my original program, BTW.  I'm still trying to

&gt 

If my hypothesis is correct, and if there is in fact no synchronization
method available in capi:display to tell you when the initialization has been
fully performed, then all I can think of for you to do is to wait until
capi:display has done it's (up (editor interface)) before you do your (down
(editor interface)). 

Because your application is complex, it's taking longer to initialize than
the example you posted here. The race now being won in the example but losing
it in your app. Perhaps your app's initialization being preempted or is also
yielding for some reason, returning control back to foo before the interface
has scrolled its editor panes. Try adding e.g. (sleep 0.1) after
(mp:process-allow-scheduling). Adjust the timing until things work and the
user isn't terribly annoyed.

If that works, you'll at least have a work-around until LispWorks can tell
you about or provide you with a real synchronization mechanism. Without that
mechanism, though, the app may perform differently on machines of different
speeds.

Anyway, whether I sort-of-understand what's happening or not, I'm interested
to know if adding a given amount of sleep after the
mp:process-allow-scheduling "fixes" your problem.

No, it doesn't.  I had tried that already.  Of course, there's still
the chance that there's a bug in my code somewhere.  Currently, in my
"real" app the scrolling position gets only updated after I click into
the editor pane once and then leave it.  Oh, yeah, best of all is that
I only have these problems in the delivered app - in the IDE all is
fine.  Sigh...  (This doesn't apply to my toy example, though.)

Thanks for your thoughts on this,
Edi.

One would think but it didn't. ... (trace 'editor::move-line-to-position)
showed me nothing at all. I used some (setf (symbol-function ...) foo to get
some more information.

In the example used to produce the following, the only call to your example's
(down (editor interface)) comes from the :create-callback. I also removed the
mp:process-allow-scheduling from foo.

CL-USER 9 &gt (foo)

#&lt;EDITOR::I-POINT "foo" 0 offset 0 218903EC&gt NIL)

Call to CAPI-INTERNALS:LOOP-PROCESS-EVENTS
Call to (METHOD EDITOR::PROCESS-EVENTS-UNTIL (CAPI:INTERACTIVE-PANE T))
Call to EDITOR::RUBBER-STREAM-WAIT
....

It looks like it is the editor, not capi:interface-display, that is moving
the line back to position 0, and the editor is doing so after capi:create
:around and capi:interface-display have finished.

Your example, by the way, works fine for me in delivery at level 0 and at
level 5 (when foo includes the call to mp:process-allow-scheduling followed
by the call to down).

You might try the same debugging technique I used above in your delivered
application. Make an output stream you can see later, e.g. an open file, call
it *so*. Include a (format *so* "~&amp;down ...") call in #'down.

(setf *mltp* #'editor::move-line-to-position)

(setf (symbol-function 'editor::move-line-to-position)
   (lambda (&amp;rest args)
      (format *so* "~&amp;editor::move-line-to-position ~A" args)
      (dbg:output-backtrace :all :stream *so*)
      (apply *mltp* args)))

Maybe the timing is somehow very different in your app than in the example.

Thanks, that was a very helpful tip.  I could now find out that in my
app ADJUST-SCROLLBAR is called in the right places and does what it's
supposed to do but /always/ (even long after startup and
initialization) there's a call immediately following it which moves
the editor pane back to position 0:

  editor::move-line-to-position (#&lt;EDITOR::WM-WINDOW "foo" 218E34D4&gt #&lt;EDITOR::I-POINT "foo" 0 offset 0 218E33EC&gt NIL)
  Call to (SUBFUNCTION 1 FOO::MAIN)  ; that's the redefinition from above
  Call to EDITOR::MAYBE-UPDATE-WINDOW-IMAGE
  Call to EDITOR::REDISPLAY-WINDOW
  Call to EDITOR:REDISPLAY
  Call to WIN32::PROCESS-MESSAGES
  Call to MP::WIN32-PROCESS-WAIT-FOR-EVENT
  Call to MP:PROCESS-READ-EVENT
  Call to CAPI-INTERNALS:LOOP-PROCESS-EVENTS
  Call to CAPI::INTERFACE-EVENT-LOOP
  Call to CAPI::INITIALIZE-AND-PROCESS-EVENTS
  Call to (SUBFUNCTION MP::PROCESS-SG-FUNCTION MP::INITIALIZE-PROCESS-STACK)

As I said, this behaviour mysteriously stops as soon as I click into
the editor pane once and leave it.  Hmmm....

Thanks again,
Edi.

You might also try using editor:process-character to call your  
function that manipulates the editor. According to Martin, this is  
critical on the Mac and necessary in some cases on Windows/Linux. I  
have had to jump through a lot of hoops to make things work on the  
Mac with the interface and editor running in separate processes.

   John&gt DESCRIPTION:

   John&gt I'm trying to setup an interface editor pane to edit a file.  
It works
   John&gt except that the insertion point is placed at the end of the  
editor
   John&gt buffer and the text is scrolled to this location at the end.  
If I hit
   John&gt the home key, the display flashes but nothing happens.  
Hitting it a
   John&gt second time actually scrolls the buffer to the beginning.

This is a multithreading problem, because the editor operations need  
to run in
their own thread in the Mac OS X version of LispWorks, not the thread  
of the
CAPI window.  The way to initiate this is using the function
EDITOR:PROCESS-CHARACTER, which can be passed a list containing a  
function and
its arguments.  Note that you should not perform CAPI operations using
EDITOR:PROCESS-CHARACTER, only editor operations.

E.g.

(defun set-buffer-file (ed path)
   (let* ((pane (edit-pane ed))
          (buff (capi:editor-pane-buffer pane))
          (window (capi:editor-window pane)))
     (editor:process-character
      `(editor:find-alternate-file-command nil ,path ,buff)
      window)))

   John&gt Works great now, thanks for your help on this.

   John&gt Is this a work-around for OS X only or is it acceptable to  
do this for
   John&gt other platforms? Eventually I wish to target Linux and Windows.

Yes, it is the best thing for all platforms.  On the other platforms,  
editor
commands are run in the thread of the CAPI window, but
EDITOR:PROCESS-CHARACTER also sets up the current editor window and  
buffer,
which some editor commands need to function correctly.


   John&gt I have other editor commands called from capi menus (e.g.
   John&gt editor:revert-buffer-command). These seem to work OK. Do I  
need to
   John&gt change all of them to use editor:process-character?

Yes.

Thanks.  I remember this issue when porting to the Mac but I wasn't
aware that it might be necessary for Windows as well.  I'll give it a
try.

Cheers,

Yeah!  That actually did the trick.  I actually had to wrap
PROCESS-CHARACTER around a function which was seemingly unrelated but
now everything works as expected.

Thanks a lot,
Edi.

Of course it's code in the capi:interface process, not capi:display, which
does the (up (editor interface)) equivalent after capi:display returns. I
made the same error in other places in that post. Must connect brain with
fingers ...

I see the output of APROPOS and the corresponding DEFSTRUCT in the
editor sources but what code do you actually use to switch "always

Mac as well as PC (in mac-mode.lisp and pc-mode.lisp).

&gt Other than changing the input style, one possible fix might be to

&gt than just a temporary point as you have done in the adjust-scrollbar

I'll try that.

Thanks,
