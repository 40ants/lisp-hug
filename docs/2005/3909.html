                <h1>Changing the font of column headers in CAPI:MULTI-COLUMN-LIST-PANEL and the 
                 MENUBAR in LWL</h1>
                <pre>How do you do the above?

Also, I have a number of font problems moving an application from LWW 
to LWL (LWL 4.2.7, I know it's old)

As an example, there seem to be something wrong with the way fonts are 
selected.

I have the following specs

(defvar *helvetica-14* (gp-make-font :family "Helvetica" :size 14))

(defvar *helvetica-16* (gp-make-font :family "Helvetica" :size 16))

Then I make a TITLE-PANE with :FONT *helvetica-16* and a BUTTON with 
:FONT *helvetica-14*, and the resulting BUTTON font is larger than the 
resulting TITLE-PANE font.  Again this is for LWL 4.2.7.

Has anybody observed this behavior?

Cheers

Marco


PS.  Lispworks gentlefolks,  I do hope that LWL 4.4.5 has a different 
color scheme!!!!!!!!  :)

This sounds familiar, but hazy.  Here's a note I wrote a year or more ago:

Under Mandrake 9.2 Linux, gp:find-best-font with :weight :normal often returns 
a bad match (10-pt font, regardless of requested size).

Changing the call to use :weight :medium appears to work much better. &nbsp;:Medium 
is not mentioned in the documentation as far as I can tell.

                 <pre>There are some nice Xresouces you can set to make Lispworks a little
prettier (particularly less sea-green :) ) The URL (which I think I got from
this list some time ago) is the following:

ftp://ftp.lispworks.com/pub/software_tools/contrib/Xresources/stephane.perrot/

Add the contents of Lispworks.res to your Xresources file, or use
whatever method
you like to add resources, and you'll probably be quite pleased.
