                <h1>Nasty problem with KMRCL and LWM</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

I've been doing some work with TBNL and have found something nasty with 
how TBNL interacts with LW for Mac OS/X 4.4.0

I've 'isolated' the demonstration of the problem to the lisp code that 
I've attached. That code assumes that you have KMRCL loaded.

The behaviour is not nice. For example, before I run a test (which I'll 
describe in a moment) the real memory used by LW is 74.3MB and virtual 
142.27MB. After the test it is real 257.72MB and virtual 814.26MB. The 
output from (ROOM) is mostly unchanged. LW is also in a bad state. I 
can't close or open windows, button images are disappearing, and dialog 
boxes are invisible.

The test is simple:
   1 -- make sure KMRCL is loaded
   2 -- compile the code below
   3 -- run: (trouble::start-trouble)
   4 -- from a console run: ab -n 1000 -c 10 
http://localhost:3333/tbnl-araneida
         (this is the apache benchmark program, it is going to hit the 
'server' 1000 times with 10 concurrent requests)
   5 -- stand back

The little piece of code is pretending to be an HTTP server on port 
3333. It returns a constant HTML page.

I've tried this using other socket connection techniques with no 
difficulties. Just this one caused trouble.

I'm curious to know if this is only LW for the mac, and I'm curious to 
know if other mac users have this problem.

No matter what, this isn't a great way for LW to fail.

Thanks for any help,

Cheers,
Bob

I wasn't aware of this problem but I was able to reproduce the behavior 
(Mac OS X 10.3.8, LWM 4.4.0, PowerBook G4, 1GB RAM).

&gt The behaviour is not nice. For example, before I run a test (which

&gt disappearing, and dialog boxes are invisible.

I'm not sure if any of this data is useful but... I ran the test 
several times w/ LispWorks.app and each time I had to run "ab" several 
times to get it to slow down and eventually lock up (sort of). In my 
testing LispWorks had to hit ~400MB resident and &gt3GB virtual before it 
locked up. Still curious I poked at the process w/ Shark, ThreadViewer, 
and gdb - in each case the main NSApplication thread was in a tight 
loop down in "pthread" territory (it was hard to capture a backtrace).

I also tried the same test in a non-gui image I had built - again the 
same behavior, including eventually one rouge thread. Shark revealed 
that the largest amount of time (~20% of cpu time) was spent in various 
Mach vm_*() system calls.

Out of curiosity I (naively) explored LispWorks behavior under heavy 
memory allocation. I fired up my console image (LispWorks.app dumped w/ 
:environment nil :multiprocessing t), loaded swank, eval'd the 
following:

(defvar x nil)
(dotimes (i 300)
   (push (make-array (* 1024 1024) :element-type 'unsigned-byte) x))

Around ~400MB resident, ~450MB virtual all listeners (both console and 
slime) stopped responding. Looking at the process w/ ThreadViewer there 
was again one thread off in a tight loop, but unlike the "big-trouble" 
cases this time the rogue thread appears to be purely in lisp land. All 
the while memory usage slowly creeps higher w/ the cpu ~75% active.

....more info for what it's worth.

FWIW, I don't see this problem with LWL 4.3.7 and LWW 4.4.0 - seems to
be a Mac problem.

I've continued playing around with this. It appears that I was wrong 
about (ROOM), or that I've changed something in the test, or both.

After   25 hits I get: Total Size  53248K, Allocated 29555K, Free 13394K
After 3025 hits I get: Total Size 110976K, Allocated 87771K, Free 12901K

There is a about 19.4K allocated per hit that is never recovered.

I played around with the test Greg came up with that allocated memory. 
If you retain the memory you seem to get the same behaviour as I'm 
seeing. If you release the memory you do not (though it takes maybe 
30-60s on my machine to settle down, if you try using LW in that time 
you get some nasty stuff happening *sometimes*).

It looks as though the nasty behaviour of LW is related to large 
amounts of retained data. Based on Greg's test that looks like a LWM 
problem.

It also looks as though something is retaining memory in the 
'big-trouble' test. It sure isn't obvious to me where that is 
happening. KMRCL or LWM? Since only LWM seems to have the problem I'm 
thinking LWM.

Are there any tools in LW to debug memory allocation?

Cheers,
Bob

This doesn't sound very plausible as the problem seems to be Mac-only.
Exactly the same software runs without problems on Linux and Windows.
