                <h1>minimizing editor windows</h1>
                <pre>Hi all, 
   I'm running Mac OS X 10.3.9 and Lispworks 4.4.5
I get a bus error any time I try to minimize a window.
Does anyone else experience this behavior, and is 
there yet a patch? 

(The backtrace to the terminal doesn't seem all that 
helpful, and the one that I can get (on the chance that
I actually get the error in a sheet) is tough to copy, as
I can't scroll, copy, etc. If no one has seen this before,
I'll try to get the backtrace.)

I don't experience this behaviour, neither in LW windows nor in my
own application windows (same OSX/LWM versions as you).

- Do you get it regardless of the state of LW (i.e. can you reproduce
it with a "clean" LW, with empty .lispworks etc.)?

- Have you tried rebooting?

- Have you tried running LW as a different user? 

- Do you have any extensions installed that might affect the behaviour
  of windows, the dock, etc.?

I have had similar problems but not with window minimisation (probably 
because I don't do that). I don't get a lot of bus errors, but I have 
had them. If I start getting situations where LWM has repeated problems 
(i.e. the next time I start it) then I've found re-starting OS/X will 
give me a few days peace.

Don't know about patches.

So that I can get some kind of record, I always start LWM from a bash 
shell by running something like:

/Applications/LispWorks\ 
4.4.5/LispWorks.app/Contents/MacOS/lispworks-4-4-5-darwin 2&gt&amp;1 | tee e1

(that's all one line for anyone not used to the shell)

BTW, quite often LWM is unresponsive at the console after one of these 
incidents, sometimes not.

I promised last week to submit a bug report about this and I didn't get 
a chance.

Cheers,
Bob

                 <h1>Re: minimizing editor windows</h1>
                 <pre>Well then, taking some of the suggestions I've seen (thanks all!)
I've : 
   existed my desktop manager (multiple desktops)
   rebooted to a point where my only screen is that built into the powerbook
   made the dock non-hiding
   added lispworks to the dock 


So, I'll:
   Start lispworks from the Terminal, and when it comes up, I'll try to 
minimize the listener by pressing the yellow minimize button. Note that
Lispworks has been started without the user init file, and without the site
init files. 

The error I get is not immediately a lispworks error, but rather the
"The application lispworks-4-4-5-darwin has unexpectedly quite."
To which I respond that I would not like to submit a bug report to Apple.
There is now a bus error shown at the console.

I do notice that the error in the console appears slightly before the
OS error appears.I don't know whether this is just a timing issue, or
if this is significant.

At the error in the console, I printed the long backtrace, which I've 
posted here:
http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~tayloj/minimizing-backtrace.txt
(I didn't want to attach a 204K file to a mailing list).

Has anyone any ideas based on that?
