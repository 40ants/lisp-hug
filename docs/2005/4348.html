                <h1>Pinboard layout: dynamically adding children</h1>
                <pre>Is there a way to dynamically add children to a pinboard layout?

I see CAPI::ADD-PINBOARD-OBJECT in the class browser but this generic  
function is not documented.

     Thanks, Joel

I've done this by modifying the layout description directly with

  (setf capi:layout-description)

which seems to work.  One thing to watch out for is that the children
at the end of this list are drawn on top of the others.

HTH,
Edi.

                  <pre>Big thanks to everyone who replied!

After much deliberation I think I'll go native Cocoa for my poker  
game client. This would be more like going with the flow as opposed  
to swimming upstream with CAPI ;-).

This is what I usually do as well, but you can also use manipulate-
pinboard. See the pinboard-movement example!

Yes, from the description of MANIPULATE-PINBOARD:

  "These operations can also be effected using (SETF
   LAYOUT-DESCRIPTION), but MANIPULATE-PINBOARD is much more efficient
   and produces a better display."

However, I seem to remember that in one of my apps I replaced the
(SETF LAYOUT-DESCRIPTION) calls with MANIPULATE-PINBOARD and after
that it didn't work anymore so I undid the change.  Unfortunately, I
forgot the details - have to dig it up.

Cheers,
Edi.
