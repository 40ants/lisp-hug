                <h1>Launching application with a document</h1>
                <pre>Hi, does anybody know how to launch an application so that it
will load the document file supplied?

On the Macintosh Common Lisp this was done easily with a
little function (launch-application "application name" "file") that I'm
missing...

I know that LispWorks has the capability to communicate with
other programs, but I have to admit that the documentation appears
much too complicated for a person without a deeper knowledge on
Windows internals.

Any hints to the right direction would be helpful.

Pekka

On Windows there's SHELL-OPEN:

  (capi-win32-lib:shell-open nil "/bla/foo.doc")

will open the document with Microsoft Word.  Obviously, this only
works with the application that opens this document type by default.

HTH,
Edi.

                 <pre>Cool! I will experiment with that.

Nothing.  The Personal Edition doesn't load init files.  See the
fourth "limitation" here:

  &lt;http://www.lispworks.com/downloads/index.html&gt

However, Bill Clementson describes a workaround in his blog:

  &lt;http://bc.tech.coop/blog/050831.html&gt
  &lt;http://bc.tech.coop/blog/041219.html&gt

FWIW, he also posted a similar technique for Windows some time ago.

Cheers,
Edi.
