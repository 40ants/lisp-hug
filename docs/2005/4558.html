This is just a wild guess, but I get the impression that some symbol
names have been truncated to 3 characters where they shouldn't have
been.  Maybe it helps to use the :KEEP-SYMBOLS delivery keyword?

If it is something symbol name truncation then I think you can also try  adding

:symbol-names-action nil

to the call to deliver.

This will keep the full names of the symbols that are retained in the image 
(rather than retaining extra symbols in the image).
