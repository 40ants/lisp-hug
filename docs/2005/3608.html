No, if I recall from looking at his code it's a much simpler version of that
interface. We didn't need transactions and some of the other advanced
features of berkeley db.

I can't say much more because this stuff is proprietary. We're not selling
the interface, but I'm sure our cto considers it intellectual property just
the same.

I mentioned our work to illustrate that bdb is a very suitable choice. We
basically runtime encode our objects through the ffi we wrote into bdb. No
secret, in fact I think Foley does the same thing. Ours is just simpler.

Is this related to Paul Foley's interface?

Is yours available somewhere?
