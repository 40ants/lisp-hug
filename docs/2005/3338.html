                <h1>OSX users/pathnames</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

I have an application that will be used by multiple user accounts in 
OSX.  I would like each user to have a unique preference file stored 
somewhere in their user directory.  However, to access this file, I 
need some way of knowing which user is currently logged in (or better, 
a pathname to the /Users/current_username directory).  Since the 
application itself is stored only once on the hard drive, I can't see 
any way of getting at this through current-pathname.  Of course I could 
prompt the user to locate their preference file, but I would much 
prefer this to be loaded automatically. Any ideas?

Thanks,

-Chris Sims

                 <pre>Try
(parse-namestring "~/preference-file")

(as "~" will get you the home directory)

In LispWorks 4.4, (sys:get-folder-path :my-preferences) will return 
the pathname of the user's Preferences folder.

What is the result of USER-HOMEDIR-PATHNAME calls?  This is what it's
for, so I hope it works (it does on Windows and Unix).

I simply use a pathname that begins with "~/". Works fine on both OS X
and linux. You should obey conventions for where to put configuration
files, though, i.e. my OS X config is put in ~/Library/MyProgram
whereas the linux directory is ~/.my-program.

&gt On OS X it should be ~/Library/Preferences/MyProgram. 

Are you sure? As far as I can tell, only a few programs do that.
E.g. Apple's Mail and Safari both create a ~/Library/&lt;program&gt
directories (for storing data) and creat .plist files 
(~/Library/Preferences com.apple.mail.plist and 
com.apple.WebFoundation.plist).

Well, it *is* localized, its name appears to be "Bibliotek" whenever I
put Norwegian language on top of my language preference list, but the
way folder names is localized in OS X is pretty innocent: The names
are translated in Finder and in standard file dialogs, but their real
names are the english ones, and your unix shell and your application
will see those.
