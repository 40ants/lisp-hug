Have you tried any file formats other than bmp? The documentation shows  
that 4.4.5 supports several formats beyond previous versions.

There is an example in examples/capi/graphics/images.lisp.

&gt
&gtThe function gp::decode-dib-header hard-wires a test for depths (1 4 8
&gt24). I wouldn't know whether this is just a test that's out-of-date
&gtgiven the availability now of other depths, or whether there are more
&gtfundamental problems with the library which does the translation.
&gt
&gtI'm not aware of any general purpose image-processing libraries in
&gtlisp, but maybe I was looking in the wrong places?
&gt
&gtFailing any of this, does anyone know of any general purpose libraries
&gtwhich I can commend to my user and which will successfully translate a
&gt16-bit image into 24-bit?
&gt  
&gt

Can MS Paint open it? It it can it can save it at  8, 256 colors and 
24bit depth.
