                <h1>Lispish Make (Common Defsystem, ASDF, what else?)</h1>
                <pre>I remember from browsing the list archives that some people were using
a LW built-in make facility. I cannot find it in the LW environment
and documentation. Is there anything else apart from the Common
Defsystem that I'm missing? Should I use ASDF or the Common Defsystem?

    Thanks, Joel

In the Help menu, choose Search and look for "defsystem" to find the 
LispWorks documentation.

One of the advantages of using ASDF is that most freely available Lisp 
libraries use it. If you are developing everything yourself and only in 
LispWorks, the built-in defsystem should be fine. Otherwise, it might 
be worth checking out ASDF so you don't have to deal with more than one 
approach.

Thanks Pascal! Now which menu do you use for that? :-)
