                <h1>Adding slots to an existing class definition</h1>
                <pre>
Hi,

Is there a standard way to add slot definitions to an existing class?

I've appended a bit of code that is quite rigid but that successfully 
adds a second slot to an existing class. It is hard coded but 
illustrates the only technique I've managed to come up with.

This can be generalised easily enough, but surely there is a better 
way. For one thing, this is definitely not going to work in at least 
some other implementations of CL.

Thanks,
Bob

Defines a class called my-class with a single slot 'a

The extend-my-class function defines a list, new-slots, that defines a 
new slot 'b in the way expected by clos:ensure-class. It then iterates 
over the direct slots of 'my-class and adds those to the new-slots 
list, also in the expected form. Then clos:ensure-class is called with 
new-slots containing definitions of both the old and new slots.

This seems to work.


(defclass my-class ()
   ((a :accessor a :initform nil)))

(defun extend-my-class ()
   (let ((new-slots (list (list :name 'b
                                :readers '(b)
                                :writers '((SETF b))
                                :initform 'nil
                                :initfunction 'raw::return-nil))))
     (dolist (slot-defn (class-direct-slots (find-class 'my-class)))
       (with-slots
           (clos::name clos::readers clos::writers clos::initform 
clos::initfunction)
           slot-defn
         (push (list :name clos::name
                     :readers clos::readers
                     :writers clos::writers
                     :initform clos::initform
                     :initfunction clos::initfunction)
               new-slots)))
     (clos:ensure-class 'my-class :direct-slots new-slots)))

Why not just subclass? Is there a particular reason why that isn't possible?

I'm not a MOP expert, but your approach looks reasonable to me.


&gt For one thing, this is definitely not going to work in at least some
&gt other implementations of CL.

That can be easily fixed by:

- using the standard MOP functions SLOT-DEFINITION-NAME, SLOT-DEFINITION-READERS,
  etc. instead of your

   (with-slots
       (clos::name clos::readers clos::writers clos::initform clos::initfunction)
      slot-defn

- using (CONSTANTLY NIL) instead of 'RAW::RETURN-NIL

- USEing the MOP package of the implementation you want to port it to.

Something like the following (lightly tested with Lispworks and Allegro):

(defpackage :test
  (:use :common-lisp
        #+lispworks :clos
        #+allegro :aclmop
        ;; Add MOP packages for other implementations if necessary.
        ))

(in-package :test)


(defclass my-class ()
   ((a :accessor a :initform nil)))

(defun extend-my-class ()
  (let ((new-slots (list (list :name 'b
                               :readers '(b)
                               :writers '((setf b))
                               :initform 'nil
                               :initfunction (constantly nil)))))
    (dolist (slot-defn (class-direct-slots (find-class 'my-class)))
      (push (list :name (slot-definition-name slot-defn)
                  :readers (slot-definition-readers slot-defn)
                  :writers (slot-definition-writers slot-defn)
                  :initform (slot-definition-initform slot-defn)
                  :initfunction (slot-definition-initfunction slot-defn))
            new-slots))
    (ensure-class 'my-class :direct-slots new-slots)))

FWIW I had a similar need a couple of years ago, and hacked up
something to extend a class at make-instance time if unknown initargs
were supplied to make-instance.

I see I also tossed in a rudimentary add-slot method, but I don't
think I've used it anywhere.  The code is for CMUCL, but should be
fairly straight MOP.  I recently updated it to make sure it compiled
on recent CMUCL, but other than that I've not looked at it for ages.
It was mostly a MOP training exercise.

I've put the code up at
&lt;http://www.klingenberg.no/~pok/mop-utils.lisp&gt.  The license should
probably be something suitably BSD-ish.

Adding slots to an existing class can be achieved with the so-called  
destructive mixins that are part of AspectL - see http://common- 
lisp.net/project/aspectl/

Example: Assume you have a class person defined as follows.

(defclass person ()
   ((name :accessor name :initarg :name)))
At a later stage in the program, you can add new slots to such a  
class, without repeating the complete class definition, as follows.

(with-class 'person
   (class-add
    :direct-slots
    '(age :accessor age :initarg :age)))

The code is portable and runs on several Common Lisp implementations.  
However, it's very easy to shoot yourself in the foot with  
destructive mixins because I have added no checks whatsoever. So, for  
example, if some of your slot options are incorrect, or you try to  
override a slot from a superclass in some incompatible way, you will  
probably not get an exception, but the chances are high that your  
system will become just unusable and must be restarted.

I have stopped working on this further because I think I have found a  
better, more declarative approach by now. ContextL is a new library  
(that is going to supersede AspectL - I have basically thrown away  
the AOP notions because they don't make much sense in Common Lisp, so  
I had to find a new name... ;). Among the features of ContextL, there  
are partial classes that allow you to spread class definitions into  
different layers. The above example would look as follows in ContextL:

(defclass person ()
   ((name :accessor name :initarg :name))
   (:metaclass partial-class))

(deflayer info-layer)

(defclass person ()
   ((age :accessor age :initarg :age))
   (:metaclass partial-class)
   (:in-layer info-layer))

The different partial definitions in the different layers contribute  
to the same class, so here the class person will have both the name  
and the age slots. You can even redefine the two partial classes  
independently, so if you say this subsequently:

(defclass person ()
   ((employer :accessor employer :initarg :employer))
   (:metaclass partial-class)
   (:in-layer info-layer))

....the class will lose its age slot and gain an employer slot, but  
the name slot will not be touched.

I think this is a better way to deal with "extra" slots. Especially,  
it gives you all the safety nets that CLOS provides for preventing  
bad class definitions.

ContextL is not publicly available yet. I expect to be able to make  
it available in August or September the latest. The code runs on my  
machine on seven different Common Lisp implementations, so I think  
portability is not an issue. (The only thing holding me back from  
uploading the code to some server right now is that I want to set up  
a darcs repository and make the code asdf installable. Uploading new  
versions of AspectL was always a little bit too much work for my  
taste, and I want to avoid that for ContextL, so I would like to do  
the right thing from the start this time.)

<br>
1)&nbsp; If you are in an interactive development mode then you add
fields if you realise you &quot;made a mistake&quot; - really this class should
have had these felds, but you only just realised it.<br>
<br>
2) You subclass for &quot;intrinsic&quot; structural reasons ; the super class is a valid parent of 2 or more subclasses.....<br>
<br>
I have in mind a sort of Domain Specific Language Tool - so 1) would be
&quot;Of course Customers have names, duh!&quot;, whilst 2) would be &quot; Customers
who are individuals have Dates of Birth whilst Customers who are
companies have VAT numbers&quot;.<br>

So both approaches are valid IMHO :-)<br>
