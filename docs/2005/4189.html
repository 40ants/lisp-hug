                <h1>Expanding a derived type spec</h1>
                <pre>Hi

I am pretty sure this is not standardized.

Suppose I have

(deftype non-negative-integer ()
   '(integer 0 *))

or

(deftype square-matrix (n)
   `(array * (,n ,n))

How do I get the "expansion" of NON-NEGATIVE-INTEGER or of
(SQUARE-MATRIX 3) in different Lispworks?

Cheers

Well, you must have some expander somewhere to do this step.

apropos got me

(type::expand-user-type '(non-negative-integer))

=&gt (INTEGER 0 *)
