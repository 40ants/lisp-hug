                <h1>Motif background</h1>
                <pre>Is there a way to change the default blueish color of the Motif widows 
and menus? I'm aware of the method using X resources, but I was looking 
for a way to make all the changes in LispWorks so that a delivered 
application looks correct without any setup. Ideally, I would like for 
the window and menu backgrounds to default to the colors used by KDE or 
GNOME if that is where the application was launched.

I also noticed I can specify :background in my interface to change the 
color, but it does not change the background color of the dynamically 
generated menus. And there does not appear to be a :background initarg 
for menus. So I was hoping for some global setting I could change so it 
would not be necessary to mess with this at all.

It appears to be possible to call xrdb at startup in a delivered app to 
change some of the LispWorks defaults. Are there problems with this 
approach? It seems I should be able to call xrdb -merge to set defaults 
without overriding anything the user might have set.
