&gt Subject: RE: DSPEC question - I'm too dumb
&gt 
&gt &gt Would someone with a better understanding of DSPEC be so nice to
&gt &gt explain to me what to do?
&gt 
&gt I have a number of examples that I put together when I was trying
&gt to get to grips with the dspec stuff.
&gt 
&gt Below are two examples, one for the case where there is a single
&gt definition for a given name and that name is the cadr of the
&gt defining form, and one for the case where there is a single
&gt definition for a given name that that name is not the cadr of the
&gt defining form.
&gt 
&gt I think the warning at the start of the file relates to the fact
&gt that the file contains definitions and uses of the defining
&gt macros (but I don't remember for sure).

I've placed my full set of examples at

http://www.nomistech.com/misc/dspec-lw-4-3-correct-usage.lisp

As well as the examples mentioned in my previous message, there
is an example that wraps DEFMETHOD and there are examples that
don't wrap an existing defining macro.

The "lw-4-3" in the filename is a result of the dspec faciliy
changing a lot for that version. I'm pretty sure all the
examples still work with LW 4.4.5.

I've just tidied that up a little so it's easier to read.
(The technical content is unchanged.)
