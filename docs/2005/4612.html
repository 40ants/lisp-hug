                <pre>Hello,

Can someone tell me how to bring Lispworks or any application 
window in front of all other applications?

Thanks,

Francis

In its simplest, capi:activate-pane must do. I would recommend accompaning
it with the following:

(defun show-raise-restore (interface)
 ;;; Bring hidden or iconic interface to front restoring its 
  ;; to last normal or maximized.
  ;; CAPI Bug?   Maximized and hidden window becomes visible 
  ;; but restored to normal size though doc states:
  ;; ...depending on how the interface was visible in the past.
  (case (capi:top-level-interface-display-state interface)
    ((:hidden :iconic)
     (setf (capi:top-level-interface-display-state interface) :restore))
    (otherwise
     (capi:raise-interface interface))))

Are you using MS Windows  ?

On Windows you can use the Win API function SetWindowPos with HWND_TOPMOST 
and SWP_NOMOVE

I am not aware of a CAPI version of this, so you might have to use 
CAPI:SIMPLE-PANE-HANDLE and your own FLI definition of  SetWindowPos

cheers

I was meaning an external application. Would the following work 
on an external application? (I'm CAPI ignorant, I never had a 
chance to use it actually).

Yes, right now, but I would prefer a portable solution as target is Linux too.

Thanks for the advice,
