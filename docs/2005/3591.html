I would also consider sqlite:

 http://www.sqlite.org/

I havn't used it myself, but I've heard from others that it's very fast, easy
to set up, and has Lisp bindings.

If you want your database backend to be OO-based, and you're using LispWorks,
then you may use this in conjunction with SQL-ODBC or (with LW Enterprise), the
CommonSQL stuff.

This route is also nice because other languages can share access to the data
more easily than a Lisp-specific backend.  You also have a nice query language
to pull the data (i.e. SQL), and with the CommonSQL, can automatically turn the
relational data into objects.

Or with CLSQL.
