                <pre>Note, that simply placing a work on this list does NOT put it into the
"public domain." See, for example, 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Granting_work_into_the_public_domai
n

http://www.unc.edu/~unclng/public-d.htm

If you intend for something to be in the public domain, you need to (at
least) declare it as such, and there are strong arguments that a work
cannot be voluntarily released anyway (q.v.). Copyright, at any rate,
remains with the author for their life + 70 years by virtue of the fact
that it's probably on yours (or someone's) disk drive. And if you are
transmitting from a corporate account, it's at least 95 years.

My suggestion is to explicitly release it with the creative commons
license:

http://creativecommons.org/

They also have a form for dedicated a work into the public domain, but
again, it has questionable legal validity (particularly in other countries
that have no "public domain" notion).

&gt Marco,
&gt does this work for you on Mac OS X? If so, would you be willing to

I have not tried it yet.  But of course.  If it works, it will be put 
on the list, hance in "public domain".
