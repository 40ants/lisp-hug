We're looking for some clues. :-)

I use Subversion for my LispWorks development, but I have not done  
any integration of the two if that is what you are asking. I think it  
would be neat to write a bunch of editor commands and some GUI tools  
for Subversion in LispWorks. I wish I had the time.

I use the svnX Subversion interface for the Mac:

http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/24158

This is good for day-to-day operations and management, but it does  
not really help with setting up the repository. Your best bet there  
is the Subversion manual and the command line.

                 <pre>We use subversion at our lab with Lisp sources and some compiled
files too, all created in LispWorks. Is this what you mean?
