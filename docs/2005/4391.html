                <h1>[ANN] YstokGrid 0.4 - CAPI-based grid widget</h1>
                <pre>Hello,

This is the fourth release of YstokGrid, a graphical user interface widget
based on the CAPI library for Xanalys(R) LispWorks(R).

YstokGrid, or YGrid for short, is distributed under a LLGPL style license.

    http://lisp.ystok.ru/projects.html

YGrid  was developed under LispWorks 4.2, 4.3 for Windows.
Compatibility with Linux or Mac must not be of much effort due to the following:
- Code is conditionalized with #+win32 feature,

General
-------
YGrid provides convenient GUI environment for working with data in tabular
form. The main design purpose was to present RDBMS records in rows.
With YGrid, you can edit in place, add, or delete records. YGrid can be
included into any CAPI interface window as an ordinary pane.

Basic Features
- Text display, text input, and check button columns.
- Enabled or read-only columns.
- Ghost columns, i.e. calculated from the values of other columns.
- Callbacks on interactive user actions.
- Selecting rows with various styles of choice-interaction via a row header.
- Column width and row height changeable via a mouse gesture or
  programmatically.
- Assigning graphics args (foreground or background color, font etc.) to
every cell differentially.
- Sorting and filtering rows.
- Searching a single column via a kind of "Find what" dialog.
- Undo editing performed on cell or entire record.

Text Column Features
- Horizontal alignment: left, center, or right.
- Automatic word wrapping.
- Customizable print-function, read and write converters.
- Full-fledged capi:editor-pane used for editing cell values.

What Is New in Release 0.4
--------------------------
- text-display-column for rendering static text.
- editable-pinboard is factored out and encapsulates basic editing
facilities.
- Professional Edition is announced (http://www.ystok.ru/products.html).

What Is New in Release 0.3
--------------------------
- search-grid.lisp implementing grid-searcher.
- toolbars.lisp factoring out standard records menu and toolbar.

What's New in Release 0.2
--------------------------
- The Win32 header-control widget was replaced with a home-grown header row
class; the class is called column-header-row and provides word-wrapping
column titles.
- The sorted-grid subclass provides built-in sort and filter facilities.
- Number and currency format localization, automatic initialization of
locale-specific parameters from Windows Regional Settings.

Bug reports and suggestions are welcome.

That URI gives an error.

This one

  &lt;http://www.ystok.ru/products/index.html&gt

announces a Professional Edition but I couldn't figure out how much
you charge for it and if and how it's available.  Or does the sentence
"These systems are localized and only available in Russian." apply to
YstokGrid as well?

Cheers,
Edi.

                 <pre>I'd love some help in getting this to run on LWM 4.4.5. I'm pretty  
clueless about packages and don't know what it takes to get it to load.

                 <pre>There seems to be a bug in capi-hacks.lisp also around line       (capi:popup-confirmer nil

but after that I got it compiled at least.
