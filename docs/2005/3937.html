                <h1>how to run 4.4.5 personal under Ubuntu?</h1>
                <pre>I just wanted to try 4.4.5 under Ubuntu Linux (newest version).
I downloaded the two shell scripts and the two tars, the installation
itself ran without any problems.

But when I want to run it, then it does not do what I want.
It loads the splash-screen and immediately hangs. The Lisp Monitor
appears and I can "Interrupt Lisp". After some seconds I get the debugger
(all these windows appear, so it is not completely broken).

I get a message telling me:

Warning: (Xt Warning) Actions not found: TextInputPaneCompleteText
X ERROR
  Display: #&lt;X-LIBRARY:DISPLAY ":0.0" = #x08070C90&gt
  Error: BadName (named color or font does not exist)
  Major opcode of failed request: 45 (X_OpenFont)


I looked into
ftp://ftp.lispworks.com/pub/software_tools/reference/lw445/readme-4-4-5.pdf
under troubleshooting and found a few words about the file located in
/usr/local/lib/LispWorksPersonal/lib/4-4-0-0/app-defaults/Lispworks

I suppose the errors have to do with fonts and/or colors. At the bottom 
of this
file I found the entry
*.maxDefaultColormapColors:     50
which I then set to 10, but it did not help.
About fonts I could not find anything special in this file that might 
help me.


Regards,
André

Hi André,

 Which version of Ubuntu are you running (sorry I have no idea what newest is),
 because I've had no problems running 4.4.5 on Warty.

 I'd also suggest moving the app-defaults file away and restarting lispworks
 since it's quite possible that it's asking for a font that the base 
 distribution doesn't have.

Regards 
  Sean.
