I'm looking for a similar GETURL function.  What's the best thing to
use?  

Is the best thing DO-HTTP-REQUEST in acl-compat?  or is there a newer
better thing that I don't know about?

Thanks!

I think AllegroServe's DO-HTTP-REQUEST is still the most complete
function for this task.

Depending on what you need you might also be interested in Klaus
Harbo's patch to use persistent HTTP connections with this function:

                 <pre>Hi, this makes me asking a question. DO-HTTP-REQUEST indeed works very 
well, I tried it few times, but it seemed not to relocate the page, so if 
anybody knows how to get it relocating make a notice.

&gtAnyway, DO-HTTP-REQUEST usually does that automatically.  See the
&gtkeyword arguments :REDIRECT and :REDIRECT-METHODS.  Specifically, if
&gtyou're doing a POST then you won't be redirected with the default
&gtsettings.
&gt
&gtI guess the short answer is: RTFM... :)
&gt
&gtCheers,
&gtEdi.

Yea .. but on the other hand if I hadn't ask it would have taken me a long 
time to discover :-)

Thanks!!

Another option is to write a simple wrapper around curl using  
system:call-system. It only takes a couple of functions and lets curl  
do all the hard work :). The hardest part is reading the curl  
documentation and understanding all of the options.
