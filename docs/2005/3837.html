                <h1>Objective C avail in LWM personal 4.3.7?</h1>
                <pre>Am I right in thinking that LWM Personal 4.3.7 does not support the 
Objective C API?

I'm getting an error message:

Error while reading: Symbol "ENSURE-OBJC-INITIALIZED" not found at all 
in the OBJC package.

I also note that there's a downloadable Objective C and Cocoa User 
Guide for LWM 4.4.5 but not for 4.3.

I'm still trying to get the simplest possible speech synthesis to work 
in LWM. What was an easy one-liner in MCL looks like it'll take either 
waiting for LWM Personal 4.4.5, paying for Professional, or using XCode 
to create a dynamic library and using the FLI.

Any advice on the path of least resistance would be appreciated.

Yes, I believe the API was published with version 4.4.

Ok, if you want least resistance :)
