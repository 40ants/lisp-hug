                <h1>Custom editor commands and Undo</h1>
                <pre>If I write my own editor command (which might delete a couple of
characters and insert some others) how can I make sure that the
modification as a whole is "registered" as one Undo step, i.e. such
that C-x u will revoke the whole command?

Thanks,
Edi.

See the recording-for-undo macro in the editor source (macros.lisp).  
For an example, see the function newline-and-indent in indent.lisp.

While the macro John recommended does what I want I run into errors
when using this one.  Hmm, maybe I'm just too dumb.

Anyway, my problems are solved... :)

Thanks,
Edi.

Thanks, that's what I was looking for.

&gt As a matter of interest, what was the error?

I've written a replacement for LispWorks' "Complete Symbol" function
which uses DELETE-NEXT-CHARACTER-COMMAND and SELF-INSERT-COMMAND to
change the contents of the buffer.  If I wrap

  (editor:collect-undo (editor:current-buffer)
    ...)

around this code and press C-x u after using it I get

  ** Processor Fault #xC0000005 at #x20B82959 (#&lt;function
  EDITOR::DELETE-CHARACTERS 20B82932&gt).

As I said, this might as well be my fault.  I'm not really a wizard as
far as hacking the LW editor is concerned.  (Not that I'm a wizard in
anything else... :)

Cheers,
Edi.

Ah, yes, that explains it.  I was sending messages to the echo area.

Thanks,
