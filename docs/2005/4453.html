                <h1>Lispworks application Start bar behaviour</h1>
                <pre>Hi, I've made a Lispworks application that works ok, but I'm not happy
how the application behaves in the Windows Start bar:

When the Lispworks application on the Start bar is clicked it pops up
a listing of windows that are currently open.

I would prefer if the application and all its open windows would zoom
out (like quite many Window applications do). Also, if you now click
again the application on the Start bar, the application and its windows
should all be zoomed back.

So, how can I cancel Lispworks application on the Start bar for not
popping up the open windows, and instead make it call

(defun hide-my-stuff ()
    (dolist (x (capi:collect-interfaces 'my-windows)
       (hide-interface x t)))

And when the Lispworks application on the Start bar is clicked again,
it should call

(defun show-my-stuff ()
    (dolist (x (capi:collect-interfaces 'my-windows)
       (show-interface x)))

Pekka

Are you sure they do? Or are you thinking of the Windows 3.1-style
"MDI" interface that most Windows programs (notable exceptions are
e.g. Internet Explorer) still follow (probably because the window-
handling capibilities of Windows don't quite live up to its name...).

However, if you want the MDI interface, i.e. all program windows reside inside
an application window, it's easy to implement this in LispWorks:

See the documentation of document-frame.

                 <pre>Hi, I'll check out the document-frame if it has any help. You see,
why I want the application windows all zoom out and in is that
I'm using my own (better grouped) window list manager within
the application, and also I want the application and all its windows
to hide/show as convenient as possible.
