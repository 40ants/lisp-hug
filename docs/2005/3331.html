                <pre>BTW. When I wrote "We went through this..." I meant we here at Bloodhound,
not we on this list. When I re-read my post it sounded a bit condescending;
that wasn't my intention.

Cheers, David.

Thanks a lot.  My memory is getting clouded.   That did it.  I was 
indeed dumping an image with database connections open.

&gt
&gt
&gt Hi
&gt
&gt I have a nasty problem I cannot figure out.  This is for 4.2.7 on
&gt Windows.
&gt
&gt I have an application which works just fine while the full CL
&gt environment is up and running but which crashes with a "Processor fault
&gt error" when delivered.
&gt
&gt The error appears when trying to access a MySQL database (latest
&gt release, with latest MySQL ODBC driver).  The database connects
&gt properly (no error caught there), but doing a query bombs with the
&gt processor fault.
&gt
&gt I remember that there were some discussions about MySQL not working
&gt properly.  Any advice is welcome.
&gt
&gt Thanks

No problems.   I just knew there was some traffic about MySQL and I am 
sure that something was said on the subject. :)
Your response was right on target and it got me out of a bind.

Thanks again.

Cheers
