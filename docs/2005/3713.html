                <h1>RE: Remove and delete on an array...</h1>
                <pre>&gt Do you think lisp programmers are generally aware that using delete
&gt leaves references lying around? and of the consequences to memory
&gt management?

[BWM ] Yes, most of us are aware. Some implementations, such as Franz's
include a facility called weak arrays and weak vectors. An object is not
counted as live if the only references to it are via weak arrays or
vectors; this is one way to deal with the problem you describe. However,
removing a reference for a potentially unnecessary object is always a good
idea, though frankly for arrays that generally only happens when one no
longer needs the entire array.
In other words, the kinds of operations you appear to be performing are
not those one typically uses an array for, in any language. In particular,
the index of an array element is not expected to change for the lifetime
of an array; if the frequency of removing elements is so small, you could
bitblt and cons up a new array from the two portions of your existing
array, and then delete the reference to your old array. Alternatively, I'd
suggest a quick course on data structures where exposure to other
representations might help you develop the appropriate structure and API
you need to suit your challenge.

No, this won't work. For this to work only the stuff after the fill 
pointer would be weakly referenced, the stuff before would be strongly 
referenced. I'd rather just nil it out.

&gt  However,

This is the issue -- the *only* issue -- I've been raising about 
delete. Unfortunately, for some reason, this doesn't appear to be 
considered a good idea in CL, or I would have thought that this would 
have been implemented. If it *is* implemented, *what* implements it 
(and this was the question I asked in the very first post).

&gt  though frankly for arrays that generally only happens when one no

So arrays are temporary short-term data structures? Frankly, I can't 
recall the last time that happened in my code. Maybe if I was using 
arrays for multiple results, but I don't have to do that in lisp.

&gt In other words, the kinds of operations you appear to be performing are

Sorry, I disagree. Strongly.

&gt  In particular,
&gt the index of an array element is not expected to change for the 
&gt lifetime
&gt of an array;

I just want to do what delete does but without introducing extra 
references to the last thing in the array.

&gt if the frequency of removing elements is so small, you could
&gt bitblt and cons up a new array from the two portions of your existing
&gt array, and then delete the reference to your old array.

I think setting the non-nil elements after the fill pointer to nil is 
an easier way.

&gt  Alternatively, I'd
&gt suggest a quick course on data structures where exposure to other
&gt representations might help you develop the appropriate structure and 
&gt API

I have a clear understanding of my requirement. I'm surprised it is 
considered a challenge by *anybody*.
