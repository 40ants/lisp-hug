                <h1>persistent objects.</h1>
                <pre>

I am looking for a means of storing persistent objects on disk that can 
be rapidly moved in and out of memory for use with a distributed 
application.
The data set is fairly large (several hundred MB) and grows 
continuously.
WOOD associated with MCL works quite well for me.
For Lispworks, I tried PLOB (Persistent Lisp Objects) but was 
unsuccessful.
I am able to contract small amounts of work

Thanks,

Sheldon
