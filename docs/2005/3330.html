                <pre>I don't know if this is true for MySQL, but for LW CommonSQL one is not
supposed to dump an image or deliver an app from an image that has opened an
odbc connection. This is not yet supported in LW. We went through this
several months ago.

Subject: Problems with delivered application and SQL/MySQL


Hi

I have a nasty problem I cannot figure out.  This is for 4.2.7 on 
Windows.

I have an application which works just fine while the full CL 
environment is up and running but which crashes with a "Processor fault 
error" when delivered.

The error appears when trying to access a MySQL database (latest 
release, with latest MySQL ODBC driver).  The database connects 
properly (no error caught there), but doing a query bombs with the 
processor fault.

I remember that there were some discussions about MySQL not working 
properly.  Any advice is welcome.

Thanks

Thanks a lot.  My memory is getting clouded.   That did it.  I was 
indeed dumping an image with database connections open.

Cheers
