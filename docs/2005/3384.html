                <h1>LW DNS bindings?</h1>
                <pre>Has anyone created bindings for LW to talk to DNS, in a way more
sophisticated than simply looking up IP addresses from names, which
are available?  I want to do some grovelling around DNS zones and I
thought it might be interesting to use the LW grapher...

Thanks

Don't know if that's what you're looking for but have you seen the
"Resolver" package?

Uses UFFI, so it should work with LW.

Cheers,
Edi.
