                <h1>Maybe someone missed it</h1>
                <pre>as I did. I found this features very nice in Slime you go anywhere you
find a variable put the cursor on it an run inspect. I did not find
anything like that (maybe I just missed it) and Inspect Variable
always prompts me. I assume one can modify it to do what I prefer
finding the thing at point and after that, but I helped myself with
the following:
(defun read-symbol-at-point (point &amp;key (previous t))
  (let ((as-is t))
    (when-let (symbol-name
               (read-symbol-from-point :point point
                                       :previous previous
                                       :read-package-name t))

      (multiple-value-bind (sym status)
          (find-symbol symbol-name
                       (buffer-package-to-use point))
        (if status
            (values sym status)
          (find-symbol (string-upcase symbol-name)
                       (buffer-package-to-use point)))))))
                   




(defcommand "Inspect variable at point" (p)
                "Runs the Inspector on the variable at point."
                (declare(ignore p))
  (multiple-value-bind (sym status)
      (read-symbol-at-point (current-point))
    (when status
        (editor-inspect sym))))

I guess it could be improved, but at least it does what I want. I put
the cursor anywhere type F5 (at least if you bound this function to
that key and get an inspector. Nic'n easy ;-)

Feel free to improve or forget it but do not sue me if anything went
wrong.

Happy lisping

I think I'm going to have to spend a weekend pretty soon and learn LW's

now and still don't feel that I've got any real understanding of what I 
can do. What I mean is that it feels to me that it is quite likely that 
I don't even understand what you are obtaining with your command. I am 
still in the situation where the "nice and easy" bit you mention still 
requires me to read the manual so I haven't tried your code yet. On the

mention.

It's "Inspect value" (not InspectVariable). Often, like Friedrich 
I think, I want to inspect the symbol too. That's why I have two 
different commands, both bound to a key (in fact, usually, I 
don't use the second command, Inspect-symbol-value)

Notice:
- it suffices to use editor::prompt-for-symbol (no need to define read-symbol-at-point)
- editor::*prompt-for-symbol-confirm* is bound to nil, which 
allows to inspect the symbol in just one key press. Of course 
from this inspector window, you can inspect the value too.

(defcommand "inspect-symbol" (p)
      (let* ((editor::*prompt-for-symbol-confirm* nil)
             (symbol (editor::prompt-for-symbol p))
             (old lispworks:*inspect-through-gui*))
        (unwind-protect
            (progn
              (setf lispworks:*inspect-through-gui* t)
              (inspect symbol))
          (setf lispworks:*inspect-through-gui* old))))

(defcommand "inspect-symbol-value" (p)
      (let* ((editor::*prompt-for-symbol-confirm* nil)
             (symbol (editor::prompt-for-symbol p))
             (old lispworks:*inspect-through-gui*))
        (unwind-protect
            (progn
              (setf lispworks:*inspect-through-gui* t)
              (cond ((boundp symbol)
                     (inspect (symbol-value symbol)))
                    (t (message "~s is not bound" symbol))))
          (setf lispworks:*inspect-through-gui* old))))

(bind-key "inspect-symbol" "F8")
(bind-key "Inspect-symbol-value" #\shift-f8)

p is therefor a point?
