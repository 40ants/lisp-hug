                <h1>Has anybody seen these kinds of error messages before?</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

I'm using LWM 4.4.5 on OS/X 10.3.9 and have been having a number of 
strange problems. LWM writes things to the console when this happens, 
so I've been running the development environment from the command line 
and recording all output LWM writes there.

Today I came across a really strange bunch of messages (that I've 
appended to the end of this message). These are quite peculiar as they 
started up in the development environment for no discernible reason and 
LWM then hangs. For fun, I tried delivering the application and got the 
same messages but the delivery process stopped after a little more than 
a thousand lines of this.

I deleted all of the nfasl files that are part of my project and the 
problem went away, at least for a while.

  Anyway, any ideas?

Cheers,
Bob

                 <pre>Hi again,

Well this seems to be much worse than I thought. I was able to deliver 
the application. Unfortunately I cannot get the development environment 
to start up. It either has that problem again, or hangs. I've removed 
all nfasl files on my disk. I've rebooted. No luck.

Any ideas? (a formal bug report will be coming soon).

Cheers,
Bob
