                <h1>Question about APPLY-IN-PANE-PROCRESS</h1>
                <pre>Hi!

I recently needed a text input pane that can verify its input when the
focus leaves the pane.  Luckily, I found an implementation of such a
thing which was posted here a while ago by "lisptracker" - thanks.
The slightly modified code for my version is below.

This works fine.  However, I first tried with a simpler version which
didn't have a HAS-FOCUS-P slot and where the call to PROCESS-WAIT
looked like this:

  (mp:process-wait "Waiting for blur event"
                   #'(lambda ()
                       (not (capi:pane-has-focus-p pane))))

To my surprise this didn't work as expected.  Now I'm wondering why
the call to APPLY-IN-PANE-PROCESS makes a difference here.  According
to the Reference Manual it is required when the function "modifies
[the] pane or changes how it is displayed."  But this doesn't happen
here.

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Edi.

IIRC, some previous postings have mentioned that APPLY-IN-PANE-PROCESS is
desirable for reading as well. Though this results in rather an awkward
code, the sad answer is "Focus should be checked within the interface
process" :-(
