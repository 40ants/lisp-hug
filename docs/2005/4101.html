                <h1>OpenGL pane not working - ATI Radeon 9800</h1>
                <pre>Has anyone seen this...any ideas?
When I run the OpenGL icosahedron example program I get a blank (white) window 
where the opengl display should occur. I have no problems with this on my 
desktop machine (NVIDIA TI4600 card), but on the laptop (Dell XPS, ATI 9800 
mobile chip, WinXP LWW 4.4.5 PE), all I get is the white window. 
I can run other opengl programs written in C++ but LWW doesn't seem to work.
I get no error messages and glGetError seems to be happy as well)

I've looked at KB Article 16020 and tried adding the additonal statement to %
make-context but it doesn't seem to make a difference. 

Any thoughts, help? 

Thanks,
brad

                  <pre>Thanks Martin, I tried that before sending out the message. I've got the
latest direct from ATI. What puzzles me is that I have a cd with some demo
opengl programs written in C++ which all seem to work fine. 

I guess I'll have to go through the complete opengl setup with a fine tooth
comb and see what I can find.

The only thing I can think of is a WinXP driver problem.  Maybe there is a
newer driver available for download?
