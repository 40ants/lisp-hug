                <h1>multiple undo</h1>
                <pre>What is the trick to get multiple-undo to work in an editor-pane? In  
my custom interface, I can only undo one command. If I execute undo a  
second time, it just toggles back to the previous state.

Undo works OK in the capi editor-pane example, so I'm wondering what  
I could have done to mess this up. Right now the only difference I  
see is that the example uses capi:call-editor and I'm using  
editor:process-character. And now I just noticed that it does seem to  
work correctly if I undo using ctrl-_ rather than the command-z menu  
item (which calls editor:undo-command using process-character).

Yes, it looks like the problem is related to using process-character  
before undo is called to determine if editing is happening in the  
echo area or not (i.e. I want to have editing commands work properly  
in the echo area and the normal editor pane). Is there a documented  
(or good) way to determine which is active so I can direct the  
editing commands correctly?

Thanks,

I don't follow how I would check the buffer's major mode to  
accomplish this. I'm in the capi interface process and my  
understanding is that I need to use either capi:call-editor or  
editor:process-character to call my command. So for this I need to  
know the right pane. I'm using the ugly hack below to figure this  
out, but making this call before the undo command is casing the problem.
