                <h1>MOP Documentation</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

I was wondering what documentation is provided with LW for the meta 
object protocol? For example, I can find no documentation of 
"class-slots".

I happen to have a copy of both "The Art of the Metaobject Protocol" 
(Kiczales...) and "Object Oriented Programming the CLOS perspective" 
(Paepcke), but I doubt many people do.

Cheers,
Bob

I think you mean one of

    CLASS-DIRECT-SLOTS
    CLASS-EFFECTIVE-SLOTS

dependin on whether you want just the local ones or the inherited ones too.

Well maybe... if I knew what class-direct-slots and 
class-effective-slots were -- Thanks, I'll look into them (I sent this 
email immediately after locating those two books and Keene's 
"Object-Oriented Programming in Common Lisp").

Anyway, I think this just illustrates the point very well :-)
