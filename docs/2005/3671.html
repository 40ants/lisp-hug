                <h1>mac delivery</h1>
                <pre>Hello,

I am using LWM 4.4 to build a delivery. Otherwise all works fine but 
I am still missing the
'About ' menu that is usually found in the first main menu of an application.
I found that LWM contains functions like 'mac-help-function', 
'mac-help-about' that seem to be doing something like this.
Is this true?
If so, is there an example that would demonstrate how to use this feature?

Is LWM 4.4 supporting the OSX specific 'window has changed' feature 
where the close button
in the upper-left corner gets a dot after the user has changed the 
contents of a window?

Mikael

Look at the example files full-application.lisp and 
simple-application.lisp under delivery/macos for details of how to do 
what you want.
