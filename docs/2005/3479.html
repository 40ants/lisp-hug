                <h1>Possible open source project for PostgreSQL</h1>
                <pre>I'm interested in starting an open source project to build a nice 
server management interface for PostgreSQL using LispWorks and CAPI. 
PostgreSQL is an excellent database, but setup and operation can be 
pretty daunting. The first Windows native version of PostgreSQL 8.0 was 
released a few days ago and people are still having problems getting 
started despite a standard Windows installer.

In addition to being something very useful, I think a project like this 
would bring some nice visibility to Lisp and LispWorks. Send me an 
email (or to the list) if you might be interested in participating. 
Include what LispWorks OS platform(s) you work with and perhaps what 
aspects of the project you would be interested in. If you would like to 
contribute financially or in some other way to the project, that would 
be nice too :).

I have included an outline below which summarizes my thinking on 
building a PostgreSQL server interface.

Power Tools for PostgreSQL

=====

+ Summary
   + 1 minute installation (PostgreSQL included with application)
     - drag single application/folder to the hard drive (installer on 
Windows since it is expected)
     - launch application
     - specify database cluster folder
     - create a database
     - ready for local connection
   + basic features
     - start/stop server
     - database configuration (postgresql.conf)
     - monitor logs and server status
     - backup/restore
     - run periodic tasks
     - access control (users/groups, pg_hba.conf)
     - feature to assist with application upgrades when dump/reload is 
needed
+ tasks
   + parse conf files and build interfaces
     - so many options, we probably want basic and expert interfaces
   + build Lisp interfaces for PostgreSQL tools
     - pg_dump, pg_restore, initdb, createdb, etc.
   - design a nice interfaces to tie everything together
+ other features and (way out) ideas
   - integration with Portable AllegroServe or other Lisp web server 
(separate build)
   + perform installation as a service without GUI
     - could still use console version of LispWorks for monitoring, 
backup, etc.
   + Lisp as server PL programming language
     - maybe ECL or some other Lisp would be better suited for this
   - autonomic computing features (see 
http://www.research.ibm.com/autonomic/overview/)
+ license
   - LLGPL like AllegroServe
