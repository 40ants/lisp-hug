                <h1>RE: defining function from common lisp</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

looks like in other Lisp implementations it is not defined, for example in
GCL on my iPAQ:

@LispWorks: Is it possible to port LispWorks to Intel ARM systems? Would be
nice for many handhelds and embedded systems.

Regards,

Frank

&gt 
&gt In principle, yes, though we're not planning on this currently. 
&gt 
&gt Do you have any particular application in mind?

I was developing an application in C++ for a customer, who developed an
embedded system with an ARM PXA CPU running Linux (with 32 MB flash and 32
MB RAM) and while writing it the last year, my idea was that many things
could be done easier in Lisp, especially the configuration dialogs and
routing settings (it is a music studio equipment device with a TFT display
and many digital and analog I/Os for analyzing, routing and synthesizing
surround and multi-channel audio signals in real time). I propose the
customer to write a little prototype in Lisp for free, just to see if it is
possible and to learn a bit more Lisp. The idea was something flexible like
LabView (the platform has DSPs on-board and a FPGA, which should be
configurable by the Lisp program in a very dynamic way). Perhaps next month
I'll get one platform, so I started testing with GCL on my Linux iPAQ, which
has a StrongARM and should not be very different from the machine code of an
Xscale ARM CPU (but I don't know).

Frank
