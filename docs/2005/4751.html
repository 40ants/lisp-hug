                <h1>some lisp newbie questions</h1><br>Hello there,<br><br>I have decided to re-visit Lisp and try to re-learn it.&nbsp; My first attempt at lisp was about 20 years ago, when I was finishing<br>my Computer Science degree...&nbsp; At that time, I think I had some &quot;immaturity&quot; in learning new computer languages, and
<br>out of two half/courses of Lisp, I barely managed to pass the first half, and the second half I dropped.&nbsp; At that time, I had<br>a hard time understanding the paradigms of lisp, being more used to the procedural languages such as Pascal, PL/I and
<br>C.&nbsp; Since then, I have spent about 20 years professionaly programming in just about all other languages, currently doing<br>myst of my work in J2EE world, which is what my clients want.&nbsp; Recently, I have started embedding python code, to make
<br>my application 'programmable', using Jython as an embedded scripting language in my J2EE applications with realy good<br>success.&nbsp; Since I was already using the python interpreter, my thoughts started going back to other interpretive languages
<br>such as lisp, and here I am now, attempting to re-learn it.&nbsp; I have downloaded a version of LispWorks, and am attempting<br>to do some simple examples (I have also ordered a lisp book from Amazon)....<br><br>My questions about lisp, and LispWorks:
<br><br>1)&nbsp; How does one connect from a running J2EE application to an instance of LispWorks ?&nbsp; I believe the LispWorks Orb product is such<br>a product, but I am not 100% sure.&nbsp; I am interested in both types of integration -- where a Java application instantiates
<br>an instance of LispWorks, and where a continual LispWorks daemon is running, and listening on a TCP socket (SSL and<br>non-SSL 'plain'), receiving Lisp commands and executing them. and returning back results.<br><br>2)&nbsp; Furthermore, if the Lisp instance portion of this hybrid is running, can it persist it's running
<br>environment at any time ?&nbsp; For example, if the &quot;data is code&quot; paradigm of lisp is used, and the actual lisp application has<br>grown during a 24 hour of continual running, can it save that &quot;knowledge&quot; (save itself?) to a file, so that when it re-starts, it can automatically
<br>reload that enviornment (learned patterns for example)???<br><br>3)&nbsp; Is there a good example somewhere, where Lisp has been used in an enterprise scale project?&nbsp; How does one architect<br>large Lisp projects where a Lisp portion integrates seamlessly within the enterprise?
<br><br>Thank you for your patience with all these newbie questions..<br><br>Regards, Aleksandar<br>Toronto<br><br>

I'm not sure if this is exactly what you are looking for but it might
be helpful:

Cheers,

One approach to persistence and enterprise integration/communication  
would be to use a SQL database. Here are some Lisp/Database options:

CLSQL might be the best option to use for many different brands of  
SQL databases.
