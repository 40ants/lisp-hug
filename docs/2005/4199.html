                <h1>Odd error</h1>
                <pre>Can anyone explain this error? I know that 
gethash is setf-able, but it doesn't seem to be 
incf-able. I can accept that if it's the case (though
it would seem strange to me), but it doesn't
seem that it should generate a pointer out of
memory bounds error. This was executed in  
a Listener on LWM4.4.5 Pro. The first time i 
eval'ed it I got a "The application...has unexpectedly
terminated. ..." But I clicked Cancel, and LW
stayed around.

Works without problems for me with 4.4.5 on Windows and Linux.

Cheers,

                 <pre>Ah, I just thought to test it under CLISP on the 
Mac. It works there. Also works under MCL.
Looks like LWM is misbehaving.
