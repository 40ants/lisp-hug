                <h1>Returning &amp;whole argument in compiler macros.</h1>Hi all,<br>
&nbsp; I've just run up against some weird behaviour with compiler macros in LWL 4.4.6<br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; Compiling the following code gives the error,<br>
&nbsp; LAMBDA-LIST form is not a proper list: #&lt;Quote NIL &gt;.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;(defmacro test-macro (ll &amp;body body)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `(lambda ,ll ,@body))<br>
<br>
&nbsp;(define-compiler-macro test-macro (&amp;whole form ll &amp;body body)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (declare (ignore ll body))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; form)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;(defun test-nil ()<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (test-macro () (+ 1 1)))<br>
<br>
<br>
This only seems to occur with compiler-macro's defined on macros,<br>
defining them on functions still works fine.<br>
<br>
Does anyone have any ideas?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sean.<br>
<br>

I'm not sure what you're trying to do here, but I don't think it
makes much sense to define a compiler macro for something that's
already defined as a macro.

You may want to read the 'slides' of the talk that I gave about
compiler macros:

<br>
is to be used (it's a simple implementation of the qlisp primitives)
and I would much rather decide which form to expand into (when possible) at compile
time rather than dispatch at run time.<br>
Granted it can be expanded in the macro it's just that I was quite surprised when returning the<br>
&amp;whole argument caused the macro to break.<br>

The standard explicitely allows compiler macros for macros and I can
imagine there are uses for them.

No, not without thinking about it for which I don't have enough time
at the moment.  With "I can imagine" I meant to say that as a general
rule I assume that the people who designed Common Lisp are probably
smarter than I am.  So, if they explicitely allowed compiler macros
for macros I guess they knew what they were doing.

3.2.2.1.3.1 seems to confirm this point of view.

No, it's more of a spec issue than an optimization one.<br>
