                <h1>tail merging</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

under the Linux version the compiler optimizes the toy example 
correctly;
unfortunately, it fails to optimize the real code that depends on tail 
merging.
I will, of course, unroll tail recursion manually -- this is tedious 
but doable.

But it's a pity to get stumbled on an issue like this: all other lisp 
implementations
available to me (CMUCL, Allegro CL, OpenMCL, CLISP, SBCL) optimize this 
code
into a loop without a problem; and that's what I would expect to happen.

David

I suggest that you send a bug report to LispWorks support.  As long as
you don't show the code to anyone (which is understandable for
proprietary stuff) this is hard to comment on.  Maybe it's a bug?
Maybe /you/ made a mistake?  Who knows?

&gt Lispworks 4.4.6, it causes stack overflow with any compiler

Yes, I can confirm that I also see the stack overflow on LWW 4.4.6 and
I don't see it with other Lisp implementations I have here.

&gt If you know how to make Lispworks compile it, I would be grateful.

I was just playing around and I noticed that replacing the second
LABELS with FLET did the trick for me - now the stack overflow is
away, even without declarations.

I'd still say you should file this as a bug report.

Cheers,
Edi.
