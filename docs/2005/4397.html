                <h1>Menu bars with no windows shown?</h1>
                <pre>Hi all, 
On Mac OS X, I've got an application that uses some windows, and the windows
have menubars for things like Open File, and Close File, etc. The docs seem to 
state that to have a menu, you must have an interface. I'd like to be
able to close
all the windows and have the application stay open. This is easy with the 
delivery keyword :quit-when-no-windows nil, but the problem is that I
lose all the
menus, so there's nothing that I can _do_ anymore. Is there a way around this?
I'd be fine with some sort of hidden interface that controls the  menu
bar but isn't
shown, or something like that; I'm just not sure how to address this problem at
the moment. 

Thanks in advance!

                 <pre>Ah, you can all probably ignore that last message, I just found the 
cocoa-default-application-interface, which probably answers my
question. If you know that it won't though, feel free to reply. :)
