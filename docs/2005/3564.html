                <pre>Hello,

Within LWW 4.3, the user can quickly select the option by pressing the first
character. For example,

(setq option-pane (capi:contain
    (make-instance 'capi:option-pane
        :items '(1 2 3 4 5)
        :selected-item 3)))

Now you can quickly select any alternative by pressing the corresponding
numeric key, e.g. 2 or 5. This is working while the drop-down list is shown
as well as when it is not.

In my experience, this feature is removed from LWW 4.4. Could somebody
confirm that?

Yes, I see this too.
I'm missing the old behaviour.

Yes, I have been trying to move an app I wrote in 4.1 to 4.4 and I see this
behaviour.  What happened?  This was a useful feature.  Perhaps there is
some initarg to make this functionality work again?
