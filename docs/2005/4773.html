                <h1>VMWare Win-host/Linux-guest hgfs LWL 4.3.7</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

There is background and then a problem statement.


BACKGROUND

I have a Windows XP Pro laptop running VMWare Workstation 4.5.1. I have a
Linux Debian installed as a VMWare guest OS. VMTools and everything works
great. I have several XP directories shared so they are visible to Linux. I
am trying to establish one Lisp source tree in a shared folder and have both
Windows and Linux use the files in that shared folder.

In Windows, I have a folder &lt;prefix&gt/lisp/projects/... In Linux the shared
folder name is /mnt/hgfs/&lt;sharename&gt/lisp/projects/... In Linux, in my home
directory, I made symbolic link to /mnt/hgfs/&lt;sharename&gt. Now in Linux in my
home directory I can e.g. ls ~/lisp/projects and I see the files OK. I can cd
~/lisp/projects and then 'touch x', 'emacs -nw -q x', change the file
contents, save the file, exit Emacs, and everything works with no problems.
Similarly, I can use emacs to change a file that had been created from the
Windows side. (I can create and delete files from within Linux. I can modify
files within Linux, regardless of whether the file was created in Linux or in
Windows.)


PROBLEM STATEMENT

When I'm in the LispWorks Linux IDE (LWL 4.3.7), I can open a shared-folder
file in the Editor. However, the buffer is read-only. If I toggle buffer
read-only and then try to save the file, I get an error "Cannot write to ....
it is write-protected". 

Although I opened the file via the symbolic link ~/lisp/..., the file name
shown in the LispWorks IDE is /mnt/hgfs/..... i.e. not the symbolic link
name. When I open the file via the symbolic link in Emacs, it shows the file
name as ~/lisp/..., i.e. the symblic link name.

Is there a way I can edit files in the shared folder using the LispWorks
Linux IDE? What is LispWorks doing differently than Emacs, and why?

FYI in the Linux guest, every file in the shared folder is owned by
root.root. Trying to change the file permissions from within Linux has no
effect.

Thanks,

Jeff Caldwell
