                <h1>Questions about multiprocessing</h1>
                <pre>Hello,

How to create a new process that has its own listener window (or console)?

What are the purpose of the variables in 
mp:*process-initial-bindings*? Are these bindings always required 
when creating a new process? Or should some of them been removed in some situations?

Thank you in advance,

Francis

messages that you get if you type control characters into listener-
or collector-panes? Should one provide a minibuffer for messages,

&gt If you need the echo area interaction, then you can do it like this:
&gt
&gt (capi:contain (make-instance 'capi:listener-pane :echo-area t))
&gt
&gt and retain the pre-defined keys.

That might be the most useful solution.

Thanks a lot!

I had the same problem with an application some time ago and I ended
up providing an echo area pane (with the :ECHO-AREA-PANE keyword
argument) and hiding that pane behind a switchable layout - it's there
so that you won't get any complaints from the editor pane but the user
doesn't see it.

Works for me but if there's a simpler solution I'd also like to hear
it... :)

Cheers,
Edi.

Actually I had seen CAPI:LISTENER-PANE in the documentation but 
was looking for a more immediate solution (I have not yet practiced CAPI).

I also have seen lispworks:start-tty-listener which could be 
sufficient to me if it is possible to specify variables to be 
initially bound in the process started by start-tty-listener 
(especially *read-table* and IO variables). Is this possible?

&gt
&gtThe MP::*ACTIONS-BEFORE-SLEEPING* binding is essential.
&gt
&gtOtherwise, each binding is essential or otherwise depending what the
&gtprocess does. For example, if it uses the editor, then you definitely
&gtneed the EDITOR::*EDITOR-INPUT-STYLE* binding. If it reads, well then
&gtthe SYS::*READER-STATE* binding is useful.
&gt
&gtI don't see any real harm in leaving all these bindings as-is and
&gtsimply appending to the list as in the examples in the LispWorks
&gtReference Manual. (Do you?)

Not really. I got into difficulties with tracing some functions 
in a process I started. I looked in mp:*process-initial-bindings* 
before I realize I was trying to trace a function object. 3 years 
without programming in Lisp, I'm almost turned into a beginner again :-(

BTW, what is the LW common way to "spy" a function object like 
the one in the following example? Is it defadvice?

(defun bar () :bar)

(defstruct container ()
   (function-object))

(defvar *c (make-container
              :function-object (fdefinition 'bar)))

(funcall (container-function-object *c))

&gt
&gtIf you already have a console window then this does what I think you
&gtwant:
&gt
&gt(let ((mp:*process-initial-bindings*
&gt        (cons (cons 'greeting "Hi Francis")
&gt              mp:*process-initial-bindings*)))
&gt   (start-tty-listener))
&gt
&gtGet a console window in LispWorks by specifying the :CONSOLE argument
&gtwhen you save a LispWorks image, or by the handy trick
&gt
&gt  (READ-LINE *TERMINAL-IO*)

I take both!


&gt  &gt
&gt  &gt &gt  &gt What are the purpose of the variables in
&gt  &gt &gt  &gt mp:*process-initial-bindings*?
&gt  &gt &gt
&gt  &gt &gtThese have various purposes.
&gt  &gt &gt

&gt  &gt &gtneed the EDITOR::*EDITOR-INPUT-STYLE* binding. If it reads, well then

&gt  &gt before I realize I was trying to trace a function object. 3 years
&gt  &gt without programming in Lisp, I'm almost turned into a beginner again :-(
&gt
&gtSome Common Lisp implementations do trace function objects, whereas
&gtLispWorks traces only the symbol (or SETF name), so it could be that
&gtyou are remembering implementation-specific behavior, and have not
&gtforgotten anything really :)
&gt
&gt  &gt BTW, what is the LW common way to "spy" a function object like
&gt  &gt the one in the following example? Is it defadvice?
&gt
&gtNo, DEFADVICE has the same restriction.
&gt
&gt  &gt (defun bar () :bar)
&gt  &gt
&gt  &gt (defstruct container ()
&gt  &gt    (function-object))
&gt  &gt
&gt  &gt (defvar *c (make-container
&gt  &gt               :function-object (fdefinition 'bar)))
&gt  &gt
&gt  &gt (funcall (container-function-object *c))
&gt
&gtI would probably just put a print statement in BAR though you might
&gtwant to use something like this:
&gt
&gt  (trace (funcall :when (eq (car *traced-arglist*) (fdefinition 'bar)))
&gt         (apply :when (eq (car *traced-arglist*) (fdefinition 'bar))))


This too!

Thanks Dave,

Francis
