                <pre>Well, it's not the *only* thing. For me, the entire IDE model that Lispworks
adopted is superior to Allegro's; the former has a "working within a Lisp
machine" feel to it, while ACL seems to say "let's build a gui". My opinion,
of course.

Of course, for the future, please do not change the royalty-free 
application distribution terms.  This is what sets you apart from

Of course, of course.   I also feel that the LW IDE is much better.
