                <h1>sys:open-pipe, closing one way of :io</h1>
                <pre>Hello all, Im trying to use Argonne's otter via sys:open-pipe. I'm 
working under LWL4.4 right now, but will also be getting to the Mac
side of things too. I've got otter on my default path, 
so something like

 
&gt (let ((p (sys:open-pipe "otter" :direction :output)))
       (loop for line in '("set(binary_res)."
                          "formula_list(usable)."
                          "all x (Man(x) -&gt Mortal(x))."
                          "Man(socrates)."
                          "end_of_list."
                          "formula_list(sos)."
                          "-Mortal(socrates)."
                          "end_of_list.") do
            (write-string line p))
     (finish-output p)
     (close p))

will cause otter to output all the correct output to the xterm from which
I started lispworks. If I use "otter &gt temp.otter.out" rather than "otter",
I get the correct results in the temp file. 

The problem is, rather than reading from file, I'd prefer to just read
from a pipe. So I specify :direction :io. In that case, however, I can't
just (close p), because I do need to read from p (to get the output). 
Otter doesn't seem to start doing anything until its input is closed.
(normally I invoke it as "otter &lt; input.in"). Is there a way to close just
my output (otter's input) side of the system::pty-stream that is
returned by sys:open-pipe ?

Have you tried to call FORCE-OUTPUT or FINISH-OUTPUT to flush your 
output stream?

                 <pre>Yes indeed, I have. I was hoping that as Ctrl-D works on a console, that
sending the char #\eot and finish/force-output would get it to realize that 
input was done. Alas though, I only get an error about an invalid input 
char. If I were working with normal unix pipes (int array[2]), I'd just close 
that end when I was done. I don't really see a way to do that in this
situation.

I had a similar problem when porting ASDF-INSTALL to LW and came up
with a kludge like this:

  (sys:open-pipe (format nil "echo '~A' | otter"
                             otter-commands)
                 ...

Does that help in your case?  Maybe with "echo -e" instead of "echo"
if needed?

If it works it's still a kludge, though.  I'd be very happy if
OPEN-PIPE offered the option to get separate streams as in CMUCL,
SBCL, or AllegroCL.

Cheers,
Edi.

                 <pre>It is a little kludgey, but it does work without the need for
temporary files. I think
that unless someone shows me a way to close the components of the pipe
individually, This will be the method I use.
