                <h1>Executing a shell command on Windows</h1>
                <pre>Hi

On LWW, I have been playing around with Cygwin, CMD.EXE, 
SYS:CALL-SYSTEM-SHOWING-OUTPUT etc in order to execute the following

	cd foo; make

or

	cd foo; nmake

I keep getting errors and I can't get my head around the necessary 
incantation to make this work.

Does anybody have any ideas?

Thanks

Marco

On my system (WinXP, Cygwin installed, PATH environment variable set
accordingly) I wrote the following function which seems to work for
me:

  (defun run-program (command where)
    (let ((old-dir (get-working-directory)))
      (unwind-protect
          (progn
            (change-directory where)
            (with-open-stream
                (shell (sys:open-pipe nil :direction :io))
              (write-line command shell)
              (force-output shell)
              (write-line "exit" shell)
              (force-output shell)))
        (change-directory old-dir))))

For example: (run-program "make clean" "c:/home/lisp/foo/").

Cheers,
Edi.

PS: Or maybe you can execute something like

      "bash -c \"cd ~/foo; make clean\""

                  <pre>Thanks but this will not do.  I am looking for a way to have an 
underlying shell execute a line.

Suppose I want

	cd foo; dosomething; cd /tmp/bar; dosomethingelse

the :CURRENT-DIRECTORY arg will not do.

I understand the above is contrived, but that's how things are.

Cheers

Marco

&gt This is a Windows problem, not a lisp problem.  You can't do this in windows - 
&gt there is no ';' (concatenate command) operator in windows like there is in 
&gt unix, e.g.


Actually, there is.  The  '&amp;'  character does this.

If you run the NT command line processor CMD.COM and pass it commands
separated by &amp;, it might work.

Hello,

Maybe the easiest way: write and test your procedure first (.bat 
file) and then call sys:open-pipe like in this example of a 
procedure with 1 argument, excerpt from my application:

(with-open-stream
       (s (sys:open-pipe "g:/pe/start-server.bat foil-server-only"))
     (loop while
           (print (read-line s nil nil))))

Print calls to display possible outputs from the procedure.

Francis


&gtThanks
&gt
