                <h1>Defining macro FOO visible from BAR</h1>
                <pre>Hello all,
I'm getting an error involving macros, package visibility and 
'.' in names.

Three files have I:

test1.lisp:
(make-package :match)


test2.lisp
(in-package :match)
(export '(new.set))


test.3:lisp
(in-package :match)
(defmacro new.set ()
    `( () ))


In a listener, I run

(mapcar #'load '("test1" "test2" "test3"))

and I get the error:
Defining macro New.Set visible from package MATCH

I do not get this error if rather than new.set I just use newset (with
no period)


This is the second issue I've had recently in 4.4 with . in names. The first
was not being able to load files from the editor like "test.foo.lisp". Is this
related, perhaps? Either way, this one seems like it would be harder to 
work around. Any ideas?

                 <pre>&gt I think you would get that error if NEWSET was exported in the MATCH
&gt package.

My mistake, I do get that error. 

&gt Use a package name which is less likely to clash. For example, you
&gt could embed your project name in the package name.

Well, unfortunately it's not my code, but the SNePS system from
SUN Y Buffalo. At the moment I just turn off warning on redefinition
for the time that I load the code defining things. I guess I'll have to 
go into some package renaming later on...

&gt
&gtIn this case a safer approach (that is, safer than switching off all
&gtredefinition checks) would be to remove checking on the MATCH package
&gtonly:
&gt
&gt(SETF *PACKAGES-FOR-WARN-ON-REDEFINITION*
&gt       (DELETE "MATCH" *PACKAGES-FOR-WARN-ON-REDEFINITION*
&gt               :TEST 'STRING=))

BTW, why is the keyword package in this list? I use to define 
functions in this package (for exemple a :test function) and have 
just defined these 2 macros a few days ago:

(eval-when (:compile-toplevel :load-toplevel :execute)
   (defmacro without-redefinition-warnings (&amp;body body)
     `(let ((*redefinition-action* nil))
        ,@body)))

(defmacro without-protection-errors (&amp;body body)
   `(let ((*packages-for-warn-on-redefinition* nil))
       (without-redefinition-warnings
        ,@body)))
