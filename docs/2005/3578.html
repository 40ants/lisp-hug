                <h1>Ack function hanging LWL 4.4</h1>
                <pre>
Hi, 

I've run across a problem when running the following ack function
on LWL 4.4

(defun ack (m n)
  (declare (fixnum n m) (values fixnum)
           (optimize (speed 3) (debug 0) (safety 0)))
  (cond
   ((zerop m) (1+ n))
   ((zerop n) (ack (1- m) 1))
   (t (ack (1- m) (ack m (1- n))))))

(compile 'ack)


Running (ack 3 10) causes the editor the hang 
indefinitely (or it at least seems that way).

Running (ack 3 10) in a console image ends up
in the return value being printed out but then 
the image dies without an error.

Timing it however causes the following error messages.

CL-USER 1 &gt (time (ack 3 10))
Timing the evaluation of (ACK 3 10)
; Loading fasl file /usr/local/lib/LispWorks/lib/4-4-0-0/load-on-demand/pcl/util/callcoun.ufsl
&lt;**&gtFatal recursive stack overflow.

21423f28 2032be32 SAFE-COERCE-TO-CONDITION

21423f84 00000001 NIL

I'm assuming that the (safety 0) declaration is involved in 
this, but with safety &gt 0 a stack overflow error is signalled.

I've also noticed the same thing happening when computing factorials
using a naive algorithm. Is it possible to get this to work
while keeping the recursive algorithm or is this a known 
limitation?


Thanks, 
  Sean.

                 <pre>Sean,

Unsafe, compiled recursive code has a tendency to behave a little bit  
aggresive when the stack overflows ;-)
If you expand the stack enough, things are fine:

CL-USER 1 &gt (defun ack (m n)
               (cond
                ((zerop m) (1+ n))
                ((zerop n) (ack (1- m) 1))
                (t (ack (1- m) (ack m (1- n))))))
ACK

CL-USER 2 &gt (compile 'ack)
ACK
NIL
NIL

CL-USER 3 &gt (ack 3 10)

   1 (continue) Extend stack by 50%.
   2 Extend stack by 300%.
   3 (abort) Return to level 0.
   4 Return to top loop level 0.

Type :b for backtrace, :c &lt;option number&gt to proceed,  or :? for other  
options

CL-USER 4 : 1 &gt :c

Stack overflow (stack size 48000).
   1 (continue) Extend stack by 50%.
   2 Extend stack by 300%.
   3 (abort) Return to level 0.
   4 Return to top loop level 0.

options

CL-USER 5 : 1 &gt :c

                        (optimize (speed 3) (debug 0) (safety 0)))
               (cond
                ((zerop m) (1+ n))
                ((zerop n) (ack (1- m) 1))
                (t (ack (1- m) (ack m (1- n))))))

The declarations don't seem to add a lot of speedup though ;-)
This was done on LispWorks for Macintosh 4.4 on a PowerBook G4.

Thanks, 
  Lispworks for Linux doesn't have restarts to increase the stack
  size, but one of the config options in the editor does which 
  fixes the problem.
  
 I've also tried experimenting with the int32 api but I'm unable
 to get anything working at nearly the same speed as a plain ack
 with no declarations.  Currently I've got the following function
 
 (defun ack2 (m n)
  (declare (optimize (float 0)))
  (cond ((sys:int32-zerop m) (sys:int32-1+ n))
         ((sys:int32-zerop n) (ack2 (sys:int32-1- m) sys:+int32-1+))
         (t (ack2 (sys:int32-1- m) (ack2 m (sys:int32-1- n))))))
 
 but this is about 20-30 times slower than the plain ack.
 It seems like this is caused by ack2 consing a lot more
 (100321688 bytes standard / 3421 bytes conses) as opposed 
 to (0 bytes standard / 0 bytes conses).

 Declaring the type m and n along with declarations for 
 return types has a small effect but is still much slower.

 Has anyone else had more luck using these new functions?
 
Thanks,
 Sean.
