                <h1>IDE editor color scheme</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

I've installed Lispworks on a new machine and am trying to change the
editor color scheme for Lisp code.  So I go to Tools - Preferences - Styles
and change the styles.  This more or less works (except that the new
color scheme only become visible when I go back to the editor and switch
editor buffers twice, but that's not a big problem).

The bigger problem is that the new color scheme only seems to work for the
file that was in the editor buffer when I started the Tools - Preferences -
Styles dialog.  But I want my color scheme to work for /all/ Lisp files!
Does anybody know how I can do that?

This is driving me crazy.  On my old machine my own color scheme worked
everywhere, but I don't remember what I did to get it working.  I'm pretty
sure that this must be a stupid misunderstanding on my part, but I've run
out of ideas.

I appreciate any suggestions.

Thanks,

Arthur Lemmens

It seems that the problem has automatically solved itself.  I'm not sure
what caused it, but I now seem to get my preferred color scheme everywhere.
Sorry for the noise.
