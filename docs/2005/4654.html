                <h1>Lispworks and SSL</h1>
                <pre>
First of all, apologies for the inter-mailing list cross post.


I've recently tried to upgrade our version of portableaserve
from something totally ancient (1.2.12 ?) to the latest CVS
version.

When I did this, SSL support (i.e. HTTPS) stopped working.
I tried with both my old version of cl-ssl, and what
appears to be the currently available version.

Does anyone have SSL (server side) support working with 
portableaserve under Lispworks?  If so, what is your setup?


Furthermore, I note that there is now support for client side SSL
using LW's native ssl support, i.e. the method

#+(and :lispworks4.4 (not :cl-ssl))
(defmethod make-ssl-client-stream ((socket-stream bidirectional-binary-socket-stream) &amp;rest options)
  (declare (ignore options))
  (comm:attach-ssl socket-stream :ssl-ctx t :ssl-side :client)
  socket-stream)

There is however no method for MAKE-SSL-SERVER-STREAM.
Does anyone know how to write one?  My take is you have
to use the :CTX-CONFIGURE-CALLBACK and :SSL-CONFIGURE-CALLBACK
methods to put in some info relating to the certificate and
password files into the stream, but I don't know enough details
on exactly what to do.  

I tried this for kicks

(defmethod make-ssl-server-stream ((socket-stream bidirectional-binary-socket-stream) &amp;rest options)
  (declare (ignore options))
  (flet ((ctx-configure-callback (ctx)
	   (comm:set-ssl-ctx-options ctx :all t))
	 (ssl-configure-callback (ssl)
	   (comm:ssl-use-certificate-file my-ssl "/tmp/ca.crt" COMM:SSL_FILETYPE_ASN1)))
    (comm:attach-ssl socket-stream :ssl-ctx t :ssl-side :server
		     :ctx-configure-callback #'ctx-configure-callback
		     :ssl-configure-callback #'ssl-configure-callback))
  socket-stream)

But that's as far as I got.  This is incomplete because it doesn't
reference the key file "ca.key" (what aserve calls the :ssl-password
argument).  Also, I have no idea what ctx-options I'm supposed to set.

If someone's already done this, or knows exactly how to do this, we
could remove the requirement for :cl-ssl entirely, at least under
lispworks, to provide HTTPS support.

Anyone?  Please???  :-)

Thanks

I'm just guessing here but there's SET-SSL-CTX-PASSWORD-CALLBACK:

Yes, I have SSL working under both LWW and LWL.  It takes some massaging,
and it is not obvious as to what to do.   Give me a bit and I will pack 
up what I
have and post it somewhere.  The version of cl-ssl I use is (0.1.2), 
basically
I build/load cl-ssl before (load "INSTALL.lisp") with portable aserve.  
But you have
to push some ssl features into *features* before loading portableaserve 
and then make sure
that you force a recompile of pserve.

Here is defsystem.lisp file I use to load aserve with ssl support on 
Linux.  I think there
is some other things you might have to change in miscellaneous files 
somewhere.
