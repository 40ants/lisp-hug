                <h1>Webservers, template systems, and UTF-8</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

Thanks for all the responses on the "Recommendations for web servers" 
thread. I'll summarise and post soon.

I've been trying a few of the suggested combinations and reading about 
them. I pretty much have to be manipulating Unicode in my program and 
will be producing HTML with UTF-8 encoding.

I've seen a number of mentions of single byte character restrictions on 
HTML out.

What kind of support for UTF-8 is present?

Same question for template systems. For example, I've been having some 
difficulty with CL-WHO and extended characters in LWM. (I know it is 
rude to mention this here before talking to Edi but I'm not sure it 
isn't me causing the problem yet... I'm just having difficulty... I had 
the same difficulty with CXML but that was very easy to fix).

Thanks,
Bob

Good idea.

What do you need?  I think (correct me if I'm wrong) that on LW the
problem is that once you have a socket output stream you can't change
it's external format.  Is is that what bothers you?

This might as well be a problem in CL-WHO - I think I've never used it
for anything other than ISO-8859-1.  But that should be easy to fix.
Send a bug report to the mailing list and I'll see what I can do.

Cheers,
Edi.

I think the problem is that you /can't/ open the socket properly
(whether you use mod_lisp or one of the "pure" Lisp webservers).  Can
LispWorks socket streams have arbitrary element types and external
formats?  The documentation for OPEN-TCP-STREAM, e.g., seems to
suggest that you have to use BASE-CHAR (or a subtype of integer) and
can't make a decision about the external format of the socket stream.

And of course for a general-purpose framework like TBNL it'd be nice
if you could change the stream on the fly (like with AllegroCL's
"simple streams") depending on your output.  A binary picture needs
another external format than a UTF-8 XML document.

A workaround might be to always use octet streams and do the encoding
yourself using something like Gilbert Baumann's "runes" and "rods" -
see CXML.

&gt I've sent the change I made to CL-WHO to you via email a little
&gt while ago. It was very simple to fix (you were making an array of
&gt base-chars when everything else in my program was using simple-chars
&gt because I had set lw:*default-character-element-type*).

Thanks, I've made a new release of CL-WHO which should fix this.

Cheers,
Edi.

Thanks, that's cool.  I've uploaded a new version of TBNL (0.3.10)
which shows (within the 'test' directory) how this can be done with
TBNL.

&gt There are only a couple of things that had to be done.
&gt
&gt First, the socket has to be opened with a different element type,
&gt like so:
&gt
&gt (make-instance 'comm:socket-stream :socket handle
&gt                                     :direction :io
&gt                                     :element-type '(unsigned-byte 8))

You don't have to do that, by the way, if you COERCE the output of
ENCODE-LISP-STRING to '(SIMPLE-ARRAY (UNSIGNED-BYTE 8) (*)).

&gt Second, when writing extended characters, you should encode it to
&gt UTF-8 then use something like:
&gt
&gt (write-sequence encoded-text *apache-socket*)
&gt
&gt to write it out.
&gt
&gt This assumes that you've encode the UTF-8 string into a sequence of
&gt bytes. This is what you will get if you call
&gt (EXTERNAL-FORMAT:ENCODE-LISP-STRING s :utf-8) where s is a string of
&gt simple-chars.

Where did you know this function from?  APROPOS?  I note that the
symbol is exported but it's not documented.  I also couldn't figure
out it's argument list.  (I was hoping that there was an option to
create the necessary array type directly without the need to use
COERCE.)

Thanks,
Edi.

&gt COERCE is an interesting thing isn't it? :-) I'm not sure what to

The following simple test seems to suggest that COERCE isn't very
costly in this case:

  CL-USER 13 &gt (dotimes (i 4) (hcl:mark-and-sweep i))
  NIL

  CL-USER 14 &gt (time (dotimes (i 100) (external-format:encode-lisp-string (make-string 10000 :initial-element #\a) :utf-8)))
  Timing the evaluation of (DOTIMES (I 100) (EXTERNAL-FORMAT:ENCODE-LISP-STRING (MAKE-STRING 10000 :INITIAL-ELEMENT #\a) :UTF-8))

  user time    =      3.374
  system time  =      0.000
  Elapsed time =   0:00:04
  Allocation   = 5134080 bytes standard / 15349499 bytes conses
  0 Page faults
  NIL

  CL-USER 15 &gt (dotimes (i 4) (hcl:mark-and-sweep i))
  NIL

  CL-USER 16 &gt (time (dotimes (i 100) (coerce (external-format:encode-lisp-string (make-string 10000 :initial-element #\a) :utf-8)
                                      '(simple-array (unsigned-byte 8) (*)))))

  user time    =      3.414
  system time  =      0.000
  Elapsed time =   0:00:04
  Allocation   = 6136832 bytes standard / 15354097 bytes conses
  0 Page faults
  NIL

However, you never know if COERCE will force your Lisp to cons and
create some fresh structure (unless I'm missing something).

&gt Yep, APROPOS. It looked promising. If you open the function browser,
&gt paste in the function name (of course) then press the 'describe'
&gt button and it tells you "Lambda List: (STRING
&gt EXTERNAL-FORMAT)". There are probably better ways of finding this
&gt information, but...

Urgh, I need to work more with the IDE.  I tried the inspector and
that didn't help.

&gt Maybe somebody from Lispworks will comment on the permanence of this
&gt function.

Would be nice, yes.  I always value things that are documented... :)

Cheers,
Edi.

&gt Did you try lw:function-lambda-list ?

No, as I just wrote in reply to Bob's email I entered

  #'external-format:encode-lisp-string

into the listener and then tried

  WORKS -&gt VALUES -&gt INSPECT.

Obviously, I need to invest some time re-reading the IDE docs... :(

I also was confused by this behaviour (when I tried to find out more
about this function by trial and error):

  CL-USER 20 &gt (external-format:encode-lisp-string "foo")

  Error: Undefined external format "foo".

  CL-USER 22 &gt (external-format:encode-lisp-string "foo" "bar")

  Error: Undefined external format "bar".

  CL-USER 24 &gt (external-format:encode-lisp-string "foo" "bar" "baz")

  Error: Undefined external format "baz".

  CL-USER 26 &gt (external-format:encode-lisp-string "foo" "bar" "baz" "quux")

  Error: Undefined external format "quux".

Huh?

Edi.
