Yes this a Web Application.  I am on my children's School Council 
Executive and I
run and mantain the web site. It has parent information, volunteer sign 
up forms,
a calendar, etc.....  Here is a rundown of the system.  I am sorry but 
it has user/password
authentication and does not allow general public access, so you cannot 
visit
the site.

LWL 4.3.7 (Originally written in CMUCL, ported because of my unhappiness 
with
                  CMUCL)
FreeBSD 4.11
cvs-parser - written by your own Alain Picard, used to export the 
volunteer DB to
                  Excel.  The volunteer DB is a file of s-expressions 
(structs).
cl-smtp - Written by  Jan Idzikowski &lt;ji@neumond.net&gt.  Used to notify 
the volunteer
              coodianators of new volunteer sign-ups
calendar - written by me to generate calendars, originally based on the 
Emacs calendar
               library
xhtml - my own version of HTML/XHTML generation
portableaserve - Portable version of Franz's Allegroserve

To control the webserver I allow telnet connections into the running 
server.

The whole app runs as a daemon under my user account.

It looks to be a nice project.
Could you tell me the size of your image? I have just made a 
first image (deliver), I'm a bit surprised by its 31 Mb (level 
0), especially because it doesn't include CAPI (:interface nil).

                 <pre>As wade said, deliver 0 doesn't remove much at all.
The current state of my  game code is about 24MB at delivery level 0
and at delivery level 5 it is 3.5 MB.
