                <h1>LWL under GDB?</h1>
                <pre>One can run LWW under the microsoft debugger.

Can this be done with LWL and gdb?  I need to debug something that's going 
wrong in an FFI, possibly on the C side.

I can't speak for LWL but I've tried; w/o success, to do the same  
thing under Mac OS X. As soon as I attach gdb to LW it locks up. In  
my case I was trying to debug a C library written to work around the  
in-ablitiy to call "lisp callbacks" from a non-LW thread.

Debugging a threaded app with print statements isn't much fun. In the  
end I wrote a C client to debug the C code...

I'd love to be able to use gdb to debug the C code linked in by LW.

If I correctly recall the Handbook it is not allowed to call back from a
different thread, at least not on Windows.

Maybe something changed?
