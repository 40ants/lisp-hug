                <h1>CAPI "pulldown" menus?</h1>
                <pre>Everyone knows that HTML pages have these nice pulldown menus (the
SELECT tag) that can be used to select one item from a list of choices
but use very little screen estate.  Has someone already built
something similar for CAPI?  Or have I just missed it and it's already
in there?

I'm not talking about LIST-PANELs (too large if there are many
options) or right-click popup menus.

Thanks in advance,
Edi.

PS: A Win32-only version would be fine.

You want capi:option-pane

That would be a capi:option-pane
