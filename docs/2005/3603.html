                <h1>Find source and othjer internals</h1>
                <pre>Hello all
     I've been looking at integrating a little optimised code navigator
tool into my Lispworks (4.4) environment, mostly because I find the
various tabs on the editor to be irritating and i'd like some of the
info to be available all the time. I've got a little window that
displays definitions and packages available in a nice thin vertical
strip together with filenames (using dspecs) but there are a couple of
steps to go;

1) How to do a find source from user code, I've been searching through
the environment but not found how to do this.

2) What screen to use for the tool to integrate well (I prefer the MDI
view), I've tried (capi:convert-to-screen capi:*main-interface*) and it
seems to work but takes down the system when I breakpoint my app, I can
live with that but if there's a secret ...

3) Adding a toolbar icon and tools menu option, is there an api for this
or do I have to scan through the object browser and hammer them in by hand?

     I expect this is a bad idea but I'm learning, dspecs are fun, so any
help anyone can give will be appreciated.

     cheers

         Andrew

Use the function EDITOR:FIND-SOURCE-FOR-DSPEC-COMMAND, or perhaps
EDITOR:FIND-SOURCE-COMMAND.

Yep, that seems to do the job, don't know how I missed it :) I've got
the tool up an running now, though still not on the menu or toolbar,
seems to do what I want though. Should you wish to look ...
