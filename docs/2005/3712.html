                <h1>Multiple Monitors on Windows</h1>
                <pre>I am enhancing my running log application for Windows.  I
need to remember where the interface windows were positioned,
so the next time they are placed in the same (perferred)
position the user left them.  Everything is fine, I know
how to do that.  However I want to handle the fringe case
of where the user had a window on a second (or other monitor)
but has removed that monitor.  Now I want the window to appear
not in the perferred (non-existent) position, but on some valid
displayable area.

The problem is that the current "screen" CAPI functions do not
return a full picture of the screen layouts.  I have a two
screen system, monitor 1 is primary (1280x1024) and monitor
2 is to the left (1024x768).  CAPI:SCREENS returns only one
screen (monitor 1).  CAPI:INTERFACE-GEOMETRY returns a
list of (left top right bottom &amp;rest i-think-screen-list??).

*** BTW the documentation for CAPI:INTERFACE-GEOMETRY appears to
be wrong, it says it returns (x y width height)

Can I get the info for my second monitor with some current
CAPI function??  (If I have a CAPI interface
on the second screen its interface geometry says that
its position has a negative left and right value, I assume
from screen 0)

                 <h1>Re: Multiple Monitors on Windows</h1>
                 <pre>There was a thread with the title: "Open interface on second screen" 
a few months back (dated 7/29/2004, and so it seems to deal with
4.3, not 4.4...) that talked about this issue. Relevant excerpts would
be:

   "Our customers are complaining that with our new LWW 4.3-based beta,
   windows that should open on a second screen get cluttered on their
   main screen, making our stock trading tool almost useless (these
   traders often use even more than 4 displays!)."

   "The CAPI currently doesn't do multi-screen display."

Now, this was several months ago, and in a older version than the current
4.4, so it might not be the case. Nonetheless, it might help to take a look
at that thread. Google doesn't seem to have records of this list though, so
if you'd like, I could send you the nine messages composing the thread; just
ask.
