                <h1>nasty bug with defstruct</h1>
                <pre>Hello all, If I have the following in a file

(defstruct FOO)
(defstruct (FOO (:include FOO)))

and try to evaluate it, or compile and load it, Lispworks dies
immediately. Obviously the code is bad, and I ended up with it
after a typo or string replace, but it seems LispWorks' reaction
is a little harsh.

It also would seem to corrupt some memory in other places
too (not sure if this would be a MacOS thing, or a Lispworks thing),
as the first several times I did this, my display became garbled.
I haven't been able to reproduce that in a smaller example yet though.
You can see that here:

(I covered some things after the fact, but clearly
marked those, everything else you see is what
happened at the crash)

On LWW 4.3.7 you just get a stack overflow, which one could expect.  It 
is probably
a MacOS thing, I vaguely remember something a while on this list about 
stack overflow
problems on LWM.

                 <pre>That's good news! If I ever find out what was the key to the screen
garbage, I'll be sure to let someone know.

&gt
&gt Wow, that's messy!  I'm not sure how the screen gets corrupted, but I've fixed
&gt the LW devel code to detect the circularity before crashing.
