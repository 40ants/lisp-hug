                <h1>Bypassing CAPI entirely</h1>
                <pre>I've been using LWM for a bit now, and I'd really rather not use CAPI 
for the Mac OS X GUI - I won't belabor the issues with CAPI's HIG 
non-conformance.

In brief, I'm trying to eliminate the LispWorks menubar entirely, and 
replace it with a menubar from a .nib file. I know that there is an 
example that allows one to load a .nib. However, when this runs, it is 
still possible to access the Tools menu, which will cause the LispWorks 
menu bar to reappear.

1. It would seem that I need to eliminate the LispWorks IDE main menu 
bar entirely. How would I do this?

2. Would it be possible to have, for example, a Listener window, 
without the associated menus? Part of the problem seems to be  that 
CAPI's notion of a menu is something associated with a view, but on the 
Mac platform, menus and views are entirely orthogonal - it's possible, 
and desirable, to have a menubar and no views, and the reverse as well 
- a view with no associated menubar.

Thanks for any insights,

Ralph

Maybe it would be much easier just to make your own interfaces rather 
than trying to manipulate the menus of the existing LispWorks 
interfaces. It is fairly simple to make a listener interface (and 
editor interface) with your own menus. Below is a simple listener  
interface I use when I compile my application in "debug" mode.

In LispWorks, I assume you will still get the standard Window menu. 
You'll probably need to do a little FLI programming to get rid of that.

Best,
