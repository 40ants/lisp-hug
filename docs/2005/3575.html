                <h1>XP look and feel?</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

is it possible to create GUI applications with Windows XP look and feel
using LispWorks 4.4?

Any recommended reading?


Thanks

Andreas

Below is the response Gary sent me last fall when I asked this 
question. It mostly works but there are some cosmetic problems. For me, 
the main issue is that title panes have the wrong background color when 
used in a tab control. I mucked around endlessly with FLI calls to 
Win32, but never found a way to solve it.

When I asked Xanalys about this a while back, they suggested I add a 
manifest file to the directory where the LispWorks executable resides.  
While this will cause all LispWorks elements to use the XP styles, 
Xanalys said that they do not officially support this.

I have attached the manifest file to this message.  If the personal 
edition's executable name isn't lispworks-4307.exe, you'll need to 
rename the file and edit its content (it's a text file) to reflect the 
actual executable name.
