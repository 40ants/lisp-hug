                <h1>LWM 4.3 and Tiger</h1>
                <pre>Hi

I have a LWM 4.3 installed on my machine and I would like to upgrade to 
Tiger.  Are there any counterindications?

Cheers

All I can say is that 4.4.5 runs great on Tiger.  Sorry I couldn't be
more help.

                 <pre>LWM 4.3 kind of runs. The cocoa version has problems
with several menus... Those won't be fixed. You
would have to upgrade LispWorks.

                   <pre>I'm using command-&lt; and command-&gt to rotate through all windows.
Note also that you can use Expos√© (via mouse corner
or key) to view all windows and move between them with
cursor-left/right.

&gt 
&gt What do I type to switch around between activities
&gt like the Listener and the Editor?  I was expecting
&gt command-backquote, but that didn't work.
&gt 
&gt Ideally, I would like to be able to select a group of windows
&gt by type of activity.  For example, something-E to get into
&gt the most recent editor window, and then use command-` to
&gt switch around (only) the editor windows.
&gt

Command-` works for me.  I'm running Mac OS X 10.4.2.
