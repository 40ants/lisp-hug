The main difference probably is that CommonSQL is supported by
LispWorks Ltd. while CL-SQL isn't.

Anyway, here's a technical question: CL-SQL uses the FFI (except for
the PostgreSQL socket interface) and thus one lengthy database
operation has the potential to block all other threads on platforms
with non-native threads, i.e. everywhere except on Windows.  Will that
be the same with CommonSQL or do they differ?

Thanks,
Edi.
