&gt  &gt I'm using LWW 4.3.7 on an MS Windows XP machine with 2 GB's of RAM.
&gt  &gt It does not look like my LWW process can use more than 1 GB of memory.
&gt
&gt This new section in the LispWorks User Guide is relevant:
&gt http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw445/LWUG/html/lwuser-306.htm
&gt
&gt You could try using a tool such as ListDLLs or Process Explorer from
&gt www.sysinternals.com to see if some DLL is loaded at around #x60000000
&gt and thus preventing LispWorks from growing beyond 1GB.

Thanks a lot for the info.

With the help of Process Explorer, I got the memory map of the various
DLL's loaded in LWW's process.  Here is an edited and annotated version
of the output from Process Explorer with rows sorted based on the values
of the Base column:

Name                Size      Base        Image Base
unicode.nls         0x16000   0x260000	  0x0

                         (--- 5.5 MB ---)
ctype.nls           0x3000    0x980000	  0x0

  ... snipped ...
shell32.dll         0x814000  0x7C9C0000  0x7C9C0000

Could someone please explain to a memory idiot like me why my LWW process
can get:

  (room)
   Generation 0:  Total Size 2444K, Allocated 2149K, Free 278K 
   Generation 1:  Total Size 1858K, Allocated 1138K, Free 712K 
   Generation 2:  Total Size 977492K, Allocated 976262K, Free 1205K 
   Generation 3:  Total Size 17422K, Allocated 16999K, Free 405K 

  Total Size 999214K, Allocated 996550K, Free 2602K

after it reaches the maximum amount of memory it can get?  I thought
LWW needed a contiguous chunk of memory to operate but there are only
5.5 MB's of space between lispworks-4307.exe and ctype.nls. 

Any explanation will be greately appreciated.

Best wishes,

-cph

&gt I think you didn't read that yet :)

Actually, as a memory idiot, I had read it a few times before I 
posted to lisp-hug again.  I did not take #x20000000 seriously
because I'm using LWW 4.3.7, that doc is for 4.4.5, and I only
saw the LWW process with a base address very different from
#x20000000.

&gt The LispWorks process you see in Process Explorer is the C stub, but
&gt the Lisp heap itself is mapped at #x20000000. Therefore it has this
&gt amount of memory to grow in:
&gt
&gt (- #x5D090000 #x20000000)
&gt
&gt which is about 976.6MB

Thanks a lot for the explanation.   It makes sense to me now.

Is rebase from MS SDK the only way to move those pesky DLL's between
#x5000000 and #x7000000 to places above #x7000000?

Best wishes,

-cph

&gt A quick web search just now did not find any obvious alternative.

Thanks a lot for taking time to look for an answer for me.

Best wishes,

-cph, looking forward to the LispWorks 5.0 (especially the AMD64 port)
