                <h1>Using fonts other than Monaco in OS X IDE (or in Capi in general)</h1>
                <pre>Dear all,

I am using the latest patch of Lispworks Professional for OS X. I  
have had this problem since the previous version (when I bought the  
program), but this is still occurring in the current version. I  
wonder if it is just me who is having this problem or is this a known  
problem through out the Lispworks community.

Basically, when I go into Window -&gt Window Preferences and try to  
change fonts, I get very funny behavior if I try to choose a font  
that is not Monaco. Either:

1) the font gets reverted to Monaco, both on the menu and the font  
actually being used
2) the preference menu says I am using the font I choose, but the  
font actually used is still Monaco
3) the font size is changed to a decimal number (e.g., 11.7, 10.6)
4) the IDE actually manages to display the font I choose (that is not  
Monaco), but I get screen artifacts all over when I move the text  
cursor around.

I am also wondering if this is specific to the IDE or Capi general  
faces this same problem.

Thank you,

Dr. Atip Asvanund

Are you choosing a fixed width font? The editor only supports fixed  
width fonts. Also, see the archives for some discussion that courier  
is not a fixed width font.

                 <h1>Re: Using fonts other than Monaco in OS X IDE (or in Capi in general)</h1>There is a very nice fixed width font called Anonymous that I use, and like a lot.&nbsp; <br><br>
