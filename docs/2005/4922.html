                <h1>Large Uploads Through mod_lisp Sometimes Failing</h1>
                <pre>Hi Marc,
Hi All,

I have been using mod_lisp for several years and I am very happy with  
it.
Thanks Marc, for writing, publishing and maintaining it - I known  
from experience that doing this takes a lot of effort!

My KPAX Common Lisp Web Application Framework works with three front- 
ends:
either mod_lisp, portableaserve and my own s-http-server.

This week we were adding some functionality to one of our web  
applications that required uploading files using a multipart form  
encoded data POST request. We did this before in several situations  
and also this time things worked as expected.

However, there seems to be a problem when uploading large (multi- 
megabyte files): this fails almost consistently.

The culprit seems to be that read-sequence, trying to read the body  
string from the mod_lisp connection in one go, fails to read  
everything at once (returning less than the buffer length). Normally,  
one would then loop and try again with an offset (:start), although I  
never had to do this in the past (so I assume that the read-sequence  
implementation handles some if not most of the buffering/networking  
issues). Now, even after retrying multiple times, no more data comes  
from the mod_lisp connection socket.

I think it has to be something in mod_lisp/apache, because the same  
example test code works consistently with large files when using my  
own, very simple, s-http-server. In this case, read-sequence is used  
in exactly the same way, reading the whole posted body in one go,  
without retrying. The only difference is that the socket connection  
being read from comes directly from the browser instead of from  
mod_lisp/apache.

In the C code I see that mod_lisp is using ap_send_fb_length to send  
the body - but that doesn't help me.

Has anybody else ever encountered similar problems ?

I am using Apache/1.3.33 (Darwin) mod_lisp/2.43 with LispWorks Pro  
4.4.6 on Mac OS X 10.4.3

Thx,

Sven

I cannot confirm that there is a general problem with mod_lisp.  I've
just tried again and I can upload pretty large files (one example was
460 MB) without any problems using the test code from TBNL.  (Setup:
Debian testing, Apache 1.3.33, mod_lisp 2.43, LWL 4.4.6, TBNL 0.8.8.)

&gt The culprit seems to be that read-sequence, trying to read the body
&gt string from the mod_lisp connection in one go, fails to read
&gt everything at once (returning less than the buffer length).

Hmm, this behaviour (returning part of the buffer without blocking) is
advertised as an optional feature on AllegroCL but I wouldn't expect
LW to do that if the stream isn't closed.

Maybe you're seeing a Mac bug (in OS X, Apache, or LW)?

Cheers,
Edi.

Unfortunately I don't have much more to offer but I have run into  
similar problems in Apache2/SVN after upgrading a machine from 10.3  
to 10.4. Checkouts worked fine but checkins (uploads) of anything  
substantial failed. I eventually found this bug filed against APR.

http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=34332

I also noticed that Apple's recent instructions on getting subversion  
up an running instructed one to manually apply the same basic patch  
and avoid the the poll() system call.

http://developer.apple.com/tools/subversionxcode.html

Another tool I use; ganglia, fell victim to the busted poll() system  
call as well.

http://bugzilla.ganglia.info/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=78
http://lists.apple.com/archives/darwin-dev/2005/May/msg00220.html

Where I'm going with all this is that socket behavior does appear to  
have changed enough under 10.4 that more than one piece of code  
broken under certain conditions. It possible that Apache 1.33 is also  
running into problems.

Hope that helps.

No, I think that won't work well with really large files.  The stream
is read more or less one octet at a time and at the same time parse by
Janis Dzerins' RFC 2388 code.

&gt I still think/feel that it is mod_lisp or apache's fault, not

It could also be the operating system.

&gt Maybe I should test apache2+mod_lisp2 

I would try it if I were you - one more data point.

Would you mind testing this with TBNL in "stand-alone" mode (without
Apache/mod_lisp) to make sure this is not a bug in TBNL?  I don't have
a Mac to test with.

Thanks,
Edi.

As I already said when I answered your question this is /not/ the
case.

&gt That is reading everything at once, no ?

That's how "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" data is read.  File
uploads are sent with a "multipart/form-data" content type.  Also from
request.lisp:

  (cond ((string-equal "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" content-type)
         (and (string-assoc "content-length" headers-in)
              (form-url-encoded-list-to-alist
               (cl-ppcre:split "&amp;"
                               (get-post-data request)))))
        ((starts-with-p content-type "multipart/form-data;"
                        :test #'char-equal)
         (handler-case
           (parse-rfc2388-form-data (string-assoc "content-stream"
                                                  headers-in)
                                    content-type)
           (error (msg)
             (log-message :error
                          "While parsing multipart/form-data parameters: ~A"
                          msg)
             nil))))

Look at the code for PARSE-RFC2388-FORM-DATA.

Yes.

No, that's correct.

FWIW, you can easily test with READ-SEQUENCE if your files aren't too
large by replacing this piece of code in request.lisp

                       (parse-rfc2388-form-data (string-assoc "content-stream"
                                                              headers-in)
                                                content-type)

with this one:

                       (let ((data (get-post-data request)))
                         (parse-rfc2388-form-data (make-string-input-stream data)
                                                  content-type))

On Linux this works fine for files up to about 4.5 MB - if they're
much larger you'll hit the maximum string size limitation in LW (and
you'll see a TBNL error message in Apache's log file).

Does this work on your Mac?

Cheers,
Edi.
