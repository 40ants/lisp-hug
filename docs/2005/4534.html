                <h1>Slim Hope</h1>
                <pre>I probably know that the simple answer to this is no, but...

Would there happen to be a version of LW for the ARM(32)
processor and Windows CE (or maybe Windows 2003 Mobile)?
Even, (asking hopefully) an Alpha version, or experimental version,
an old discarded version, anything...

I really do not want to resort to eVC4 (which is embedded Visual
C++ v4)

I don't know if this helps, but you may want to consider OpenLisp -  
see http://www.eligis.com/

It's an implementation of ISLISP, which is more or less a Common Lisp  
subset and which should also be relatively straightforward (although  
still a lot of work) to embed in Common Lisp. OpenLisp lists ARM as  
one of the target platforms.

There are probably also Scheme implementations out there.
