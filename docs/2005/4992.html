                <h1>Supported Linux Versions</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

The official requirements for LispWorks on Linux state that a 2.2 or  
2.4 kernel is required. RedHat up to version 9 is mentioned as being  
supported. What about newer kernels or distributions ? Is a 2.6  
kernel on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 or 4 also supported ? Are dual  
processor machines with hyperthreading supported ?

BTW, I think I read somewhere in the docs that LispWorks on Mac OS X  
and Windows is using native multi-threading, but not on Linux (where  
it is using soft multi-threading). Is that correct ? And how does  
this relate to (web) server performance as compared to the other  
platforms ?

Thx,

Sven

I don't know what's supported, but I do run on 2.6 dual processor
Debian (no hyperthreading).

I can't speak for LispWorks in terms of "supported" but I've used LWL
on various Debian installations with 2.6.x kernels without problems.

&gt Are dual processor machines with hyperthreading supported ?

I would assume that in this case only one processor is used by LW.

Does anyone on this list have experience with multi-processor machines
and LWW/LWM, BTW?  Will a multi-threaded LW application deploy more
than one processor on these machines?

&gt BTW, I think I read somewhere in the docs that LispWorks on Mac OS X

Yes, but LispWorks announced they're going to change this for 5.0:

  &lt;ftp://ftp.lispworks.com/pub/software_tools/downloads/Amsterdam2005/LW.pdf&gt

&gt And how does this relate to (web) server performance as compared to

Web server performance with LWL has been "good enough" for me.  I
think you must have /very/ high loads before you feel a difference
between different threading models.  If you're using foreign function
calls that have the potential to block, that's another story of
course.

Cheers,
Edi.

My http-based server is not exactly a web server, but my experience is
that the non-native threads of LispWorks on linux work excellently
with even more than 100 threads. There are some problems when one of
the threads is doing really intensive I/O, and global GC (mark-and-sweep)
tends to be very heavy when there are many threads working on the same
data, but in general, I'm happy with it. I just tested now, and got very
good response times (&lt; 15ms for most requests) when accessing my LWL
server running on an Opteron server, with currently 127 threads.

LW 5.0 will get native threads on linux, in addition to a lot of other
improvements on the x68 platform. I'm really looking forward to testing
it!

OpenMCL (www.clozure.com) supports real multi-processing.

Scieneer Common Lisp:

  &lt;http://scieneer.com/scl/threads.html&gt

I also remember from playing around with SBCL that each "native"
thread appears as a Linux process in the ps(1) output.  I guess one
can deduce from this that SBCL/Linux will employ several processors at
the same time.

Don't know about Allegro/Windows or OpenMCL.

&gt From this description it's not obvious that they do better.  In

I'm pretty sure that they do better, I think that's their main selling
point.  Also note this sentence from their website:

  "Applications written in the Scieneer Common Lisp implementation can
   grow as the demands of the application grow by simply moving the
   application to a multi-processor system."

That wouldn't make much sense if only one processor can be active at
the same time.

Also, Christophe Rhodes reminded me of this c.l.l message

  &lt;http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.lisp/msg/30626f0005b0315c&gt

which seems to confirm that Scieneer is SMP-capable (and AllegroCL is
not).

I'll ask Douglas Crosher for confirmation.

So far, I /think/ we have to following situation.

  Native threads, can employ more than one processor at the same time:
  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Scieneer Common Lisp
  - OpenMCL
  - Armed Bear Common Lisp
  - SBCL (on Linux/x86)
  - Corman Lisp (???)

  Native threads, but only one active Lisp thread:
  ------------------------------------------------

  - AllegroCL (Windows)
  - LispWorks (Windows, OS X)

As a LispWorks customer I certainly wish that LispWorks moves up to
the first group in version 5.0.  I think multi-processor or at least
multi-core systems will be ubiquitous very soon.

Cheers,
Edi.

Only one data point, but I thought I'd mention it anyway: I've asked
both Franz and LispWorks on different occasions whether gethash and
(setf gethash) are thread safe. And they are.

However, be aware that (at least LW's) maphash will lock the hash
table for the duration of the maphash execution. I discovered this the
hard way - it took me some debugging before I understood that (maphash
#'pretty-slow-function *important-table*) was making my server grind
to a halt ;)

Yes, good questions.  This is precisely what has bothered me for some
time - basically nobody will tell you what exactly is thread safe in
their Lisp and what's not.  If one of the implementations out there
has a comprehensive documentation that answers these questions then
I've missed it - my apologies.  My impression is that all this is
mostly undocumented and if you're lucky you stumble upon some details
by chance, like here:

  &lt;http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.lispworks.general/3999&gt

IIRC the Java documentation shows that one can document these issues
in a pretty precise way.

I was unclear here: The lock is only a write-lock. You can still read
from the hash table during the maphash.

Well, in my case, I needed to go through the hash table and output (to
a socket) every y that matched certain criteria. My solution was to collect
those y first, and then output them (since the collection itself was fast,
it was only the i/o during the maphash that would stall it).

He just answered and confirmed that several different threads on
different processors can execute Lisp code at the same time.  The only
exception (similar to SBCL) is the garbage collector which stops the
other threads.

I have to revive this topic for a moment.

Yesterday I was bitten by the fact that threads created by "foreign"
code can't call back into Lisp.  I hope this is also something that
would be history if LispWorks were fully SMP-capable.  FWIW, it
doesn't work on AllegroCL either (although their documentation seems
to suggest it should) while it works fine with Corman Lisp.

See here (and the following messages in the same thread) for an
example:

  &lt;http://common-lisp.net/pipermail/rdnzl-devel/2005-December/000041.html&gt

How do other Lisps with "native" threads (SBCL, OpenMCL, etc.) deal
with this?

Cheers,
Edi.

PS: Yes, I know that one can deliver to a DLL as a workaround.
    However, you'll lose interactive development in this case.
