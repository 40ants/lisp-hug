That code itself works fine for me using LW445 on Windows.  Very simple
thought, did you make sure to click on the window to focus it before
mousing over the buttons - tooltips of course won't appear unless the
window has the focus.

Hey all, I'm forwarding this for a coworker, so please just reply to the

list (he reads the list, but hasn't yet registered his new email address

Hi all
 
 Using LWM445, I'd like to create a very simple toolbar with some
tooltips associated for each button.  I've been having trouble getting
it to work.  Here's what I've been trying:
 
 (capi:contain
  (make-instance 'capi:toolbar 
                 :items '(6 7 8)
                 :tooltips '("New Document" "Open Document" "Save
Document")))
 
 But tooltips don't seem to appear when I hover over the buttons.   
 Do I have to do something like set the help-callback for the
interface?   If so, how should that work?

                 <pre>The windows do indeed have focus. We can see tooltips on things like
the podium and
editor toolbars, so we can indeed see tooltips, and
capi:display-tooltip works too. I'm wondering
if perhaps the :help-callback doesn't have the right defaults or
something on the Mac?
