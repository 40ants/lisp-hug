                <h1>LWL and OpenGL</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

I just downloaded the Personal Edition of LWL just to see if I could  
get my stuff to work in Linux (Ubuntu 5.04).
I have been using Linux for 2 days so plase be gentle with me ;-)

I have couple of questions:

1) I had some strange font problems that I remember somebody else on  
this forum also had. I hacked away the default font names to resemble  
somethig the xlsfonts displayed and I could at least boot LWL without  
problems. Was there any other solution for this? It seem to me that  
some LWL dialogs/widgets/whatnots still assume fonts that do not  
exist and this generates some unexpected errors time to time. (BTW, I  
use lesstif)

2) I wonder if anybody has used any OpenGL stuff on X Window? Have  
you tried sharing textures by using a shared context? I could swear  
that I did everything by the book but still I can only get the  
texture to be visible in the shared context but not any of the other  
contexts that share it. I have managed to get this to work in OS X  
and Windows XP, though, but I do not have any experience on X Window  
system, so I thought I'd ask.

TIA,

Mika Kuuskankare
