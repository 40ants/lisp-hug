                <h1>DSPEC question - I'm too dumb</h1>
                <pre>As I already mentioned in other emails I'm porting a large amount of
legacy code (originally written for Goldhill) to LispWorks.  I have
written enough "glue" code to be able to compile and load the legacy
code into LispWorks.  There's no hope to make it run there directly
(it uses a lot of Goldhill-specific functionality) but with the code
loaded I can use LW facilities like M-. ("Find Source") to jump
through the source and find definitions which helps a lot.

However, there's one problem that remains: Many functions are defined
through Goldhill's FFI::DEF-FOREIGN-FUNCTION.  I wrote a dummy macro
like this

  (defmacro ffi::def-foreign-function (first &amp;rest rest)
    `(defun ,(first first) ,(mapcar #'first rest)))

which is enough to appease the compiler and provide me with correct
argument lists for these functions, but - the IDE can't find the
source of these definitions.  It finds the right file but then I get

  Cannot find (DEFUN ...) in XXX.LSP.

Obviously, I could deploy the DSPEC stuff to work around this but I
must readily admit that I simply don't understand it.  I tried several
different ways to use DEFINE-FORM-PARSER, DEFINE-DSPEC-ALIAS but none
of them worked.

Would someone with a better understanding of DSPEC be so nice to
explain to me what to do?

Thanks a lot in advance,
Edi.

                 <pre>&gt Would someone with a better understanding of DSPEC be so nice to
&gt explain to me what to do?

I have a number of examples that I put together when I was trying
to get to grips with the dspec stuff.

Below are two examples, one for the case where there is a single
definition for a given name and that name is the cadr of the
defining form, and one for the case where there is a single
definition for a given name that that name is not the cadr of the
defining form.

I think the warning at the start of the file relates to the fact
that the file contains definitions and uses of the defining
macros (but I don't remember for sure).

The comments contain forms that you can evaluate to test that
finding source works properly.

                 <pre>Hello Edi,

The following should be enough:

(defmacro ffi::def-foreign-function (name &amp;body body)
  `(dspec:def (ffi::def-foreign-function ,name)
     (defun name ,@body)))

(dspec:define-form-parser ffi::def-foreign-function (name)
  `(ffi::def-foreign-function ,name))

BTW, (mapcar #'first rest) is terrific version of (copy-list rest) :-)
