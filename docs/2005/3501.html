                <h1>Motif on OS X</h1>
                <pre>I'm trying to run with Motif on OS X. I installed OpenMotif 2.2.3 and 
did the default configure/make/make install. I get the error below.

I also have OpenMotif installed with fink. I found libXm.2.dylib in 
/sw/lib and created a link to it in /usr/local/lib just for fun. 
LispWorks seems to start and run OK, but then I frequently get an error 
"Unable to convert :DEFAULT into an XID" seemingly related to changing 
the cursor.

Anyone successfully using LWM 4.4 with Motif?

                 <pre>Hey,

What might not hurt to try is to uninstall OpenMotif, and try using LessTif.  I
do recall on at least one (Linux) system that while OpenMotif had trouble with
LispWorks, LessTif worked.  I never figured out why that was the case, and I
don't know if this will generalize to MacOSX/Fink.  But it may be worth a try.

I would be interested in trying this if I can figure out how to 
uninstall it. make install generated over 1600 lines of output. This is 
why I really wanted to use the fink version rather than compiling it 
myself. Let me know if there is some kind of make uninstall command I 
don't know about.

Thanks,

Hmm, while I won't object to giving this a try, my personal experience
(mainly with Debian) is that lesstif always has some degree of
incompatibility with LW, while OpenMotif generally works.

(e.g. (setf (text-input-pane-caret-position x) ...) is really annoying
 with lesstif, it works as if you supplied (1- x) with all lesstif
 versions I've tried)

&gt 

I have managed to use LW 4.4 Professional with OpenMotif under OS X,
after having tried to make it work with fink (unsuccessfully).

I did a manual install (making sure to change the default prefix to
the one expected by LW, using ./configure, as '/usr/local/lib' is no
longer the default installation directory ), and made a link named
'libXm.2.dylib' to the version of  libXm.*.dylib that comes with the
latest OpenMotif.

I don't have my mac with me, so the exact details are a bit hazy. Sorry ;-)

I haven't encountered the error you report (viz. "Unable to convert
:DEFAULT into an XID"), even after several hours at a stretch. 
However, I don't use the Motif interface very often, so there may be
circumstances under which it may happen.  Can you comment on how
frequently this error occurs, or if you've found some way to
systematically reproduce it?

Rgds,
