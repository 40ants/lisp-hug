                <h1>Lisp Movies: Episode 2: (Re)writing Reddit in Lisp is 20 minutes and 100 
                 lines</h1>
                <pre>My first Lisp Movie wasn't called 'Episode 1' for nothing...

The second Lisp Movie (Screencast) is a tutorial on building web  
applications using KPAX, implementing a prototype clone of Reddit,  
sort of anyway.

We show how to use the KPAX Common Lisp Web Application Framework to  
implement an example that is quite similar to Reddit: a collection of  
links is presented, sorted by points and sorted chronologically, a  
form allows for new links to be submitted and links can be voted up  
or down. We show how to interactively debug web applications. Finally  
we add a stylesheet to give our little application a better look  
(thanks to Nicky Peeters). Furthermore we show how Common Lisp allows  
you to write elegant code, elegantly: flexibly re-using similar code  
fragments, as well as developing and testing incrementally.

If you're interested, check out the following page for details:

Enjoy,

Sven

This is totally mind blowing! What makes it so impressive  is that  
there is no narration, no subtitles, and these aren't needed at all -  
everything is obvious from the code being typed in and the browser  
interaction. This is a testament both to the power of lisp and the  
usefulness of your kpax web-app framework.

Maybe not for lisp ultra-newbies (because it assumes some knowledge  
of common idioms like with-slots, etc.) but for anyone with even a  
few days of lisp under their belt this is a must see.

Well done, and thanks for sharing this.

Sven,

When I load reddit.lisp I get a warning that redirect-to is  
undefined. I see redirect-to-self in kpax, but no redirect-to (I've  
freshly installed kpax and all its dependencies with asdf-install  
just now so these should be up to date). Any idea what's missing here?

regards,

Ralph

Well I'm allways looking for a useable web framework, now I tried my
luck with kpax but what happens while compiling crypto.lisp the GC
starts running an never ends...

Ok it bailed out here:
(defvar *kpax-random-state* (progn
                              (add-entropy-to-dev-random)
                              (mt:make-mt-random-state (get-secure-random-seed 624)))
  "Secure random state for MT random generator seeded from
/dev/random")

Linux 2.6.13 (don't know about earlier versions) has writable
/dev/random.  Probably, it depends on kernel version.

Well I posted to Sven in a private mail that I had not trouble
compiling this part on Linux Debian unstable AMD64 2.6.10 with SBCL
0.9.7.x ... 

If it is a general problem it should not have worked with SBCL
also. However it might be that using the 32-bit LW on an AMD64 might
cause the trouble. I don't know...

You may use /dev/urandom: if there is enough entropy, it uses it; if
not, it fallbacks to common RNG.

There is this small GC monitor and it just switches to Running and
never come back....
