                <h1>*lispworks-directory*</h1>
                <pre>The description for *lispworks-directory* states:
----------
The subdirectories of | *lispworks-directory*| should include:
  |config| , which contains the configuration files.
  |patches| , which contains any public (numbered) patches that are 
distributed by Xanalys.
  |private-patches| , which is the place to put private (named) patches 
that are sent to you by Xanalys.
  |postscript| , which contains configuration files for printing using 
the CAPI printing library. See the chapter on Simple Customization in 
the / LispWorks User Guide/ for more information on printer configuration.
  |examples| , which contains various files of example code.
-----------

But on both my Mac and PC this is not the case.  The variables are set 
to |#P"C:\Program Files\Xanalys\LispWorks\" and|| 
#P"/Applications/LispWorks 4.4/Library/"|,  which means that it is 
necessory to go into "/lib/4-4-0-0/" in order to get to the various 
subdirectories listed above.  This becomes a problem since I'm running 
code that should work on varous versions of Lispworks,  and it would be 
annoying to have to use #+[version] to get to the differnent 
"/lib/x-x-0-0/".

In my particular case, I am writting code that makes use of the OpenGL 
example from the lispworks directory.  As a last resort I can copy the 
code out of the lispworks directory into my program's but I was 
wondering if there was some workaround for the descrepency noted above.

Thanks

                 <h1>Re: *lispworks-directory*</h1>
                 <pre>To answer my second question, the following functions are exactly what 
I'm looking for:
  (sys::lispworks-patch-dir)
  (sys::lispworks-examples-dir)
  (sys::lispworks-config-dir)
etc.

But there is still the matter of the discrepancy in the documentation. 
And a reference to the above mentioned functions would go well in the 
"see also" section of that page.
