                <h1>removing window borders?</h1>
                <pre> What I am trying to do is to create a full screen open-gl pane where there
are  no 
windowing system borders. Is there a parameter/setting that allows this? 
I  will need this specifically for Windows and Mac, possibly linux as well. 
 Can I do this with capi, or should I forget about capi and go down to the
OS  
 level, creating and dealing with the windows and I/O directly...seems like
a lot  
of work if capi can handle it for me. I'm also wondering about whether
there's  
 enough input support in capi or if I have to abandon that too. For games,
its  
 often more important to get the keycode than the character typed in, and
both 
the press and release events. The 1 key   above the qwerty must be
distinguished from the 
1 key on the keypad...shift key  positions may be significant. The shift key

Press/release in itself might be an event that I need.
  I've been through the capi docs and if its there i've missed it. 
Can anyone give me pointers to where I should look, or simple answers if you
know it? 
 
Should I go with SDL instead for the window setup and keyboard events (e.g.
Kenny 
Tilton's work in cells?)

 Thanks, brad
