                <h1>How to identify console image</h1>
                <pre>I want to have code in my .lispwork init file that does different
things depending on whether the image starting up is a console image
or not.  Is there a way to find out whether you're in a console image
except for checking the name of the executable?

Thanks,
Edi.

Thanks, that'll of course work.  I was looking for a generic way that
works with all console images, though.

Cheers,
Edi.

I'm not too sure how correct this is but SYSTEM::*AUTO-START-ENVIRONMENT-P*
seems to be set to nil in console images.

That seems to be what I was looking for.  Thanks!
