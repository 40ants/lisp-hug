                <h1>stack size on linux</h1>
                <pre>
Hi,

I am trying to load CXML using ASDF in my brand new lispworks 
professional for linux. I am getting a Stack overflow (stack size 
16368) error. I have read the note at 
&lt;http://www.lispworks.com/kb/f35acd8100dfd9ba8525670b0074a8d6.html&gt and 
tried putting (sys:*sg-default-size* 32000) into my .lispworks file. No 
luck, same error (the 32000 had no effect, it still overflows at 
16368).

So I worked around this problem by moving all my ASDF stuff out of my 
..lispworks file and into a file I called start.lisp, starting lwl, 
setting the size of the stack in the listener to 32000, loading 
start.lisp, compiling CXML successfully, stopping lispworks, restoring 
the .lispworks file, restarting lispworks again, this time loading the 
nfasl files for CXML, and continuing as though nothing unusual 
happened.

Isn't there a better way of doing this?

Cheers,
Bob

Have you compiled ASDF?  I seem to remember that I had similar
problems when ASDF wasn't compiled.  I have loaded CXML on Windows
without problems, I suppose that should also work on Linux.

Cheers,
Edi.

Maybe you're using one of the tarballs?  Use the CVS version instead -
it includes some LW patches I've recently submitted that aren't
released yet.  IIRC one of them was needed because a very large OR
form resulted in stack overflows when LW compiled CXML.

HTH,
Edi.
