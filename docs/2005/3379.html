                <h1>Another stupid question about graph panes</h1>
                <pre>Hi

I display relatively deep and complex graphs on a graph pane.

How do I set up the "initial" depth of the display so that only a few 
levels of the graph are shown?

(Incidentally, if I know that I am displaying a DAG, can I change the 
layout algorithm to obtain a better looking graph?  DAGs are not that 
difficult to display in a better way than what the current GRAPH-PANE 
does.)

Thanks

marco

                 <pre>marco,
     As far as I know the graph-panes and tree-view
objects have the same children function behavior.

    To get what you want (I have a similar need)
I pass  adjustable-arrays as object identifiers to the 
children-function,
where each element in the array is a unique-ID
identifying a node,  and each array describes the leafward path of
unique-IDs associated with a displayed node.

     Each time a children-function identifies further unique-ID children,
it appends them to the array and wraps each append in a list,
as output.

      This extra redundancy enables the children-function to
know how far down the tree it is,  from the length of the array.
In my case I limit the kind of children displayed depending on depth.
You could just as easily limit whether deeper children should be 
returned
at all.

good luck,

    Lawrence Au

Hi Marco!

Did you ever get a good answer to this question?  I re-read the
replies you got and to me they either sound pretty complicated or like
missing the point.

Cheers,
Edi.

I saw it and I tried it but it was my impression that this completely
disables node expansion beyond the specified depth.  I just tried
again and now it works as I hoped it should.  Oh well, must have been
too late last night... :(

Sorry for the noise.

Have a nice weekend,
Edi.
