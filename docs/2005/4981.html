I made my first Lisp Movie (Screencast) called Episode 1: HTTP Client  
and Server, showing how to use the HTTP protocol as client and server  
in Common Lisp, featuring the LispWorks IDE on Mac OS X.

Sven,
Thanks for the movie, it's really fun and informative to watch. As  
others have pointed out on c.l.l, the subtitles unfortunately go by  
way too fast. In other words, you can read the subtitles *or* you can  
watch what's happening on screen, but you can't do both. One of the  
reasons that sound narration is desirable is that you can use two  
input channels at once - As it is now, you can just read the  
subtitles if you play the movie at 1/2 speed, but then it takes twice  
as long to run and we end up watching you type v-e-r-r-r-y  s-l-o-w-w- 
w-l-y-y... ;^)

Could you possibly make the subtitles stay on screen longer - I don't  
see any disadvantage to each subtitle remaining on screen right up  
till the next subtitle begins (maybe a .1 second blackout between  
titles as a visual cue that the subtitle has changed).

Thanks again for taking the time to do this - really enjoyable and  
informative.

regards,

Ralph
