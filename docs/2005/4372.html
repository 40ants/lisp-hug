                <h1>Printing Lisp sources in color...</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

It seems to me that LispWorks for Mac can only print in black &amp; white  
(or I am missing something). I would like to have a printout, or  
actually a PDF file, that includes syntax coloring for my Lisp sources.

Does anyone know how to achieve that? (I also have access to a  
Windows machine, if that helps...)


Any help is appreciated!

Cheers,
Pascal

Black and white is all I have seen.

The only way I have approached doing this with the LispWorks editor  
is to convert to HTML/CSS or Docbook XML and then use some other tool  
to print it.

                 <pre>Hi Pascal,

Google for 'lgrind' if you're willing to use LaTeX. I did some customization
of fonts etc. and it should be easy enough to extend that to colors. lgrind
may be too limited for your purposes. Let me know if you want my files or
other hints.

I used miktek for latex and dvipdf under cygwin to produce pdf's.

Have you looked at cl-typesetting ? There is a simple lisp formatter in it.
Fixes and improvements welcome ;-) 

The formatter formatted by itself:

Here's my quick and dirty Elisp for converting some Emacs buffer into 
HTML:

------------------------------------8&lt;------------------------------------
(defun replace-string* (from to)
  (while (search-forward from (point-max) t)
    (backward-char 1)
    (let ((props (text-properties-at (point))))
      (delete-char (length from))
      (let ((string (format "%s" to)))
	(set-text-properties 0 (length string) props string)
	(insert string)))))

(defun faces:save-as-html ()
  (interactive) 
  (let* ((buffer-name (format "*HTML:%s*" (buffer-name)))
	 (buffer (get-buffer (buffer-name)))
	 (buffer-html (or (get-buffer buffer-name)
			  (generate-new-buffer buffer-name))))
    (save-excursion
      (set-buffer buffer-html)
      (insert-buffer buffer)
      (save-excursion
	(goto-char (point-min)) 
	(replace-string* "&amp;" "&amp;amp;"))
      (save-excursion
	(goto-char (point-min)) 
	(replace-string* "&lt;" "&amp;lt;"))
      (save-excursion
	(goto-char (point-min)) 
	(replace-string* "&gt" "&amp;gt;"))
      (let ((current-color nil))
	(insert "&lt;body text=\"white\" bgcolor=\"black\"&gt&lt;pre&gt\n")
	(while (not (eobp))
	  (let ((color (let ((face (get-text-property (point) 'face)))
			 (if face
			     (face-foreground (if (consp face)
						  (first face)
						face))
			   nil))))
	    (if (not (eq color current-color))
		(progn
		  (when current-color
		    (insert "&lt;/font&gt"))
		  (when color
		    (insert (format "&lt;font color=\"%s\"&gt" color)))
		  (setq current-color color)))
	    (forward-char 1)))
	(when current-color
	  (insert "&lt;/font&gt")))
      (insert "&lt;/pre&gt&lt;/body&gt\n"))
    (display-buffer buffer-html)))
------------------------------------8&lt;------------------------------------

One small problem is that some colors (named by name) displayed by the
Web browser do not exactly match those displayed by Emacs (ligther or
darker).
