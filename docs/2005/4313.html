                <h1>CoreData Experiments?</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

I was wondering some days ago if CoreData can be used in Lispworks.
xcdatamodel files need to be designed in XCode, but they can be
compiled manually with momc.
It should be possible then to initialize a ManagedObjectModel with the 
compiled  model
object file ("mom").

I'm not sure, though, what parts can stay in a nib file. Working in
Cocoa, every entity of the model corresponds to an array controller
in the nib. I'm not sure about Lispworks here.

Has anyone thought about using CoreData or done successful experiments?

thanks for sharing,

André

I believe the answer is yes... but with some work.

I started to experiment with CoreData a few days ago. I managed to  
find 'momc', design a data model in Xcode, compile it, and load it  
(using initWithContentsOfURL:). For far so good but the more I  
started to look into CoreData, the more I felt I needed to understand  
Cocoa Binding better which then sent me to read up on Key Value  
Coding and Key Value Observing.

I'm in the process of writing some abstract (in the LispWorks sence)  
objc classes which map KVC and KVO methods to typical CLOS accessors.  
The results have been promising so far... I hope to have something  
generally useful to others at some point but I don't know when that  
will be.
