                <h1>Computing size of pinboard objects</h1>
                <pre>Hi!

I want to create a couple of titled pinboard objects that'll have
different texts in them.  I'd like to have them all the same size,
namely they should be just big enough to hold the longest text.  The
texts are determined at run time.

I understand that I could create them, use PINBOARD-PANE-SIZE to find
the maximum, and then set the sizes accordingly.  However, for that to
work (i.e. in order to get at the size), I have to display them first,
right?

Is there a better way to do what I want?

Thanks,
Edi.

I would recommend calling gp:get-string-extent to determine the width of the
objects beforehand, computing maximum width, and finally creating them with
the :width argument specified.

You can use (gp:get-string-extent pinboard-layout string) to get the size of
the strings (with optional font).  You still have to create a 
pinbord-layout before
you can do that, but it does work.

I think that the creation of the interface (and thus of the graphics-port ?)
is needed before the use of get-string-extent (as for other functions of the
same family (get-character-extent, etc.)

On LW 4.3 for Mac :

(let ((layout (make-instance 'pinboard-layout))
      (string "Hello World!"))
 (get-string-extent layout string))

=&gt ERROR "can't find a font device for #&lt;CAPI:PINBOARD-LAYOUT 100BB347&gt"

Anyway, if you want to specify a font on thirst argument of
get-string-extent, the find-best-font function (witch return a font object
from a font-description), doesn't work neither before the creation of the
graphics-port.

A possibility to avoid this problem (other than the :creation-callback
evoked by Dave Fox) is to keep the interface hidden until all computations
are ok. For example :

1)

(setq interface (display (make-instance 'interface :display-state :hidden
                            :best-width 200 :best-height 100)))

2) 

forms

3) 

(activate-pane interface)


A possible problem (if the 3 points aren't directly linked up) is that
during point 2, the interface is visible in the "Window" menu (Select it in
this menu is equivalent to point 3).

************

Finally, my question to LW is:

I very well understand that computation of fonts is system-dependent, but
why is it graphics-port-dependent ? Are font objects different from a port
to another ? For instance : If I create some font objects (using
find-best-font) with a port (maybe hidden), and save it somewhere, are these
font objects valid to use with another port ? This example seems to work
normally (is it unsafe ?) :

1)

(defvar font-object nil)

(let ((interface (display (make-instance 'interface :display-state
                                                    :hidden))))
   (setq font-object (find-best-font interface (make-font-description
                                               :family "Verdana" :size 24)))
   (destroy interface))

;the variable font-object is now bounded to this object :
      
=&gt #S(FONT FONT-DESCRIPTION #S(FONT-DESCRIPTION GRAPHICS-PORTS::ATTRIBUTES
(:NAME "Verdana" :FAMILY "Verdana" :SIZE 24.0 :WEIGHT :REGULAR :SLANT :ROMAN
:PITCH :VARIABLE)) GRAPHICS-PORTS::DEVICE-FONT NIL)

;strangely the font-device needed upper is bounded to NIL...

2)

;Now it seems that I can use the same font object with any other interfaces
at any time. For instance :

(contain (make-instance 'title-pane :text "Hello World!" :font font-object))

(contain (make-instance 'text-input-pane :text "Hello World!" :font
font-object))

Ah, yes, the create-callback of the interface.  Thanks for reminding
me - your example works fine.
