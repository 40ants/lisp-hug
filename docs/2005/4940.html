                <h1>tail merging?</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

how good is lispworks at tail-call (non-self) elimination? I have a 
pretty simple code with interchanging tail calls, and all while all 
other lisps optimize it into a loop, lispworks does not. I can work 
around it, but its a pity not to have this in a lisp.

David

For example, the following code:

(declaim (optimize (speed 3) (debug 0)))
(defun LEN (s)
   (declare (type string s))
   (let ((end (length s)))
     (declare (type fixnum s))
     (labels ((UX (i n)
                (declare (type fixnum n))
                (if (zerop n) (left (1+ i))
                    (ux i (1- n))))
              (LEFT (i)
                (declare (type fixnum i))
                (if (&gt= i end) i
                    (ux i 1))))
       (left 0))))

does not seem to compile into a loop, and this call:

(len (make-array 1000000 :element-type 'base-char :initial-element 
#\Space))

causes stack overflow. Meanwhile, in CMU CL, Allegro and OpenMCL it 
runs in a fraction of a second.

According to the Lispworks User Manual (section 9.4), tail calls
will be eliminated for a DEBUG level less than 3. (I think the
default DEBUG level is 3.)

See Section 9.4 in the LispWorks User Guide. Essentially, if debug&lt;=2  
tail calls will be merged, and if debug&lt;2 and safety&lt;2, self calls  
will be optimized (IIUC).

                 <pre>Hi,

I think you need to turn off source debugging in LW

(hcl:toggle-source-debugging nil)

see

DECLAIM?  Where did you have your DECLAIM statements?  Did you try
with a DECLARE declaration within the functions?

&gt the following code snippet is NOT optimized:
&gt
&gt (defun UX (s i n)
&gt    (if (zerop n) (left s (1+ i))
&gt        (ux s i (1- n))))
&gt
&gt (defun LEFT (s i)
&gt    (if (&gt= i (length s)) i
&gt        (ux s i 1)))
&gt
&gt (defun LEN (s)
&gt    (left s 0))

I don't know what makes you sure enough to use such a strong wording
but if I look at the disassemblies of these functions, even without
declarations, I see JMPs from UX to LEFT, from LEFT to UX, and from
LEN to LEFT - pretty much what one would expect.

&gt and the following calll causes stack overflow:
&gt
&gt (len (make-array 1000000 :initial-element #\Space :element-type
&gt base-char))

Not on my machine (LispWorks 4.4.6 pro on Windows and Linux).

Cheers,
Edi.
