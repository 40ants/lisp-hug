                <h1>TREE-PANE disappear</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

this is more or less a question for lispworks. While porting code from 
4.2 to 4.4, I noticed that the class capi:tree-pane disappeared 
(starting at version 4.3, according to the personal version I have).
Is that true ?
Can it be emulated by capi:graph-pane with some special parameters ?

Sebastien.

PS : this does not appears in the release notes AFAIK, and even if it 
was not documented in the capi reference manual, the class was made 
external so I guess it was meant to be used.

I don't know what TREE-PANE were but maybe you're looking for
TREE-VIEW?

Not sure about tree-pane in 4.2, but 4.4 has something called a
tree-view (it's in the CAPI reference manual).  Doesn't that do
what you need?

I searched my code for capi:tree-pane, and found some occurrences that
were commented out and replaced with capi:graph-pane. Maybe it was
just a name change.
