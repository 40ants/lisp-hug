                <h1>Class slot count and KW performance</h1>
                <pre>Hi. Is there any relationship between the slot count of a KW class and KW
performance? In other words, if a class that inherits from
kw:standard-kb-object has a large number of slots, will that degrade
performance, especially during assertion (via assert or make-instance)?
Thanks very much...

Hi,

I think that KW CLOS objects are currently slightly less efficient than 
standard LW CLOS objects (*), but I wouldn't have thought it depended on 
the slot count. In any case this question  is really one for the support 
desk.

(*) I think that there is some pending optimization here that never got 
to the top of any priority list.
