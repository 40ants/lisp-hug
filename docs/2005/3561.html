                <h1>LWW 4.4 Pro application on non-SE Windows 98</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

I have a CAPI-based program I developed with LWW 4.4 Pro.  I've tested it on
every Windows platform I have access to:

 o Windows 98 Second Edition (SE)
 o Windows 2000 Professional
 o Windows 2000 Server
 o Windows ME
 o Windows 2003 Server
 o Windows XP Home

and it seems to work fine.  However, my customer claims that the application
doesn't run on his Windows 98 (First Edition) that he has, and therefore hasn't
approved the application.  I don't have access to such a computer, so I was
wondering if either someone who does have it could test my app out.  Short of
that, it would be nice to know if anyone's had issues delivering CAPI apps that
work on Windows 98 (First Edition).

I'll send the app to the first couple of people that wouldn't mind testing it
out, if you're running this O.S.

thanks,
dave

I only have a few data points, but I hope it helps:

- PrimeTrader (my app.) delivered with 4.2 (and 4.3) I think, was
  verified to work reasonably on a Windows 95 computer (with the
  winsock update)
- We have had several issues with both Windows 98 (1st ed.) and
  Windows ME. The only of the non-NT Windows that works sort of
  reasonably (and now I'm thinking of "works" in the general sense,
  not as in "works with LW") is indeed Windows 98 SE. Anyone who is in
  the sorry position that they have to run Windows 98 should try to
  get 98 SE (and by all means NOT ME!). (The only problem is that it
  may difficult to get these days - or maybe one can buy it
  used?). Our web page still says that supported windows versions are
  98/ME/2000/NT 4.0/XP, but I've seriously considered changing that to
  98 SE/2000/NT 4.0/XP.
