                <h1>LW bytecode</h1>
                <pre>Folks,

Please correct my understanding of the following points:

1. When I compile from the REPL then LW produces bytecode that is
saved somewhere in memory.

2. When I compile-file then LW produces a file of bytecode (NFASL).

3. Upon delivery LW converts my bytecode into processor instructions.

4. If my compiled code runs fast in the REPL then it should run even
faster after it's delivered.

Is my understanding correct?

    Thanks, Joel

No, there is no bytecode involved, compilation always results in
machine code.  Delivery just means that the resulting Lisp image is
massaged into something that the operating systems views as a
"stand-alone" executable.  A delivered application will generally not
run any faster than a compiled application executed from the IDE.

                (+ x y))

    JR&gt 1. When I compile from the REPL then LW produces bytecode that
    JR&gt is saved somewhere in memory.

No, it produces native code.

    JR&gt 2. When I compile-file then LW produces a file of bytecode
    JR&gt (NFASL).

It saves native code + possibly some housekeeping stuff.

    JR&gt 3. Upon delivery LW converts my bytecode into processor
    JR&gt instructions.

No, compiled code doesn't change, but now it is together with the runtime 
and the library in one file.

    JR&gt 4. If my compiled code runs fast in the REPL then it should
    JR&gt run even faster after it's delivered.

No, not in the sense you indicate.  One could, perhaps, come up with
rare cases where speed is measuably improved because of the way things
end up getting laid out in memory (think caches and TLBs and such).

    JR&gt Is my understanding correct?

It wasn't, but it was consistent.  Why did you think bytecodes were 
involved?

cheers,

BM

I just thought it would be easier for LW to keep bytecodes around as
opposed to native code. In any case, thank you guys for your in-depth
explanations!
