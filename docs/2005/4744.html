                <h1>Franz's tester.cl</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

Franz's open source page includes an ammended-LGPL test harness in a single
file, tester.cl:

http://opensource.franz.com/test/index.html

A search of lisp-hug on gmane, and a search on cliki, found no hits for
tester.cl. I ported it to LispWorks. The port performs the same as all the
tests in the examples on http://opensource.franz.com/test/index.html except
for the final one. In that test, ACL traps a (break...). "CLHS 9.2 break"
says "...goes directly into the debugger without allowing any possibility of
interception by programmed error-handling facilities." so perhaps ACL is
non-conforming.

I renamed tester.cl to tester.lisp to match everything else I use.

Tester.cl uses the if* macro. I seem to recall seeing it posted somewhere but
can't find it now... probably night blindness. Is the macro available? In the
meantime, I replaced if* with cond.

Tested under LWW 4.3.7.

Feedback is more than welcome.

Jeff Caldwell

You may want to look at my port called ptester (portable test). It
runs on lispworks, sbcl, cmucl, and openmcl. I wrote a some
compatibility functions for some of the non-ansi parts of
tester.
