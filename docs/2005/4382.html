                <h1>comm:start-up-server/serving web pages in parallel?</h1>
                <pre>This is possibly a silly question.

I wrote a tiny web server. Now I ask myself, what the difference
to a professional server might be.

The server started by comm:start-up-server does not accept more
connections
until the passed function returns.

Is it still possible to serve requests in parallel?

This might be interesting if my web server asks another machine to do
some
processing which will take some time. During this time the web server 
machine just idles and might serve other requests.

Any hints or pointers are appreciated :)


Thanks

Andreas

Yes. Let the function passed to start-up-server be a tiny function
that does nothing else than calling process-run-function with the
"real" function and the given fd as parameters.

Wow, striking hint. Thanks a lot.

Sure. And probably expected in the real world :). If you want to see  
some examples, download the source of Portable AllegroServe. It sets  
up multiple Lisp processes to handle requests in parallel.
