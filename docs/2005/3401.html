                <h1>Optimizing image manipulation: Help!</h1>
                <pre>Folks,

I'm new to LispWorks so any I would appreciate any pointers on how to
optimize my routine below. The purpose of the function is to return an
RGB array given an image. I work on a PowerBook G4 1.25 with OSX
10.3.7. I ran the tests while running on battery with automatic power
management so processor speed was probably reduced. I also had
BitTorrent, a browser, etc. running at the same time.

It's clear to me that the way to go is to accumulate a list of bytes
and then create a vector out of it. Referencing individual array
elements is waaaaay slower. How can I make the faster version really
fast, though?

You can grab the image from http://wagerlabs.com/lobby.jpeg . I run
this code to set things up:

(in-package "USER")
(load "~/work/opengl/host")
(load "opengl:examples;load")
(setf pane (make-instance 'capi:opengl-pane 
			  :width 300 
			  :height 400))
(capi:contain pane)
(setf external-image (gp:read-external-image "~/temp/lobby.jpg")
      image (gp:load-image pane external-image :force-plain t))

Here are the results...

(defun image-&gtrgb (port image)
  (let ((access (gp:make-image-access port image)))
    (unwind-protect
	 (progn
	   (gp:image-access-transfer-from-image access)

		 (height (gp:image-access-height access))
		 (bytes '())
		 (vector))
	     (dotimes (y height)
	       (dotimes (x width)
		 (let* ((pixel (gp:image-access-pixel access x y))
			(color (color:unconvert-color port pixel)))
		   (push (* (color:color-red color) 255) bytes)

	     (setq vector

                 <pre>I gave up on image-access because it was so slow. Instead, I used 
ImageMagick to read files and decompress them, then I convert the 
pixels into a BMP gp:external-image and hand it to CAPI to display. 
This is not real fast, but it was better than image-access.

Here's some of the code:

(defun push-bytes (val output &amp;optional (num-bytes 1))
   (declare (type fixnum val num-bytes)
            (type (array (unsigned-byte 8) (*)) output)
            (optimize (fixnum-safety 0) (safety 0) (speed 3) (space 0)))
   (iter (repeat num-bytes)
     (vector-push (logand val 255) output)
     (setf val (the fixnum (ash val -8)))))

(defmethod convert-to-external-image ((self pixmap))
   "Creates and returns an external image in 4-channel .bmp format.
CAPI won't create an image access for 3-channel files"
   (let* ((width  (width self))
          (height (height self))
          (data-size (+ 54 (* width height 4)))
          (output (make-array data-size :element-type '(unsigned-byte 8) 
:fill-pointer 0)))
     (declare (type fixnum width height data-size)
              (optimize (fixnum-safety 0) (safety 0) (speed 3) (space 
0)))
     ;; bmp format is from 
&lt;http://www.fortunecity.com/skyscraper/windows/364/bmpffrmt.html&gt
     ;; bfType = 'BM'
     (push-bytes (char-code #\B) output)
     (push-bytes (char-code #\M) output)
     ;; bfSize = overall size in bytes
     (push-bytes data-size output 4)
     ;; bfReserved (1 &amp; 2) = 0
     (push-bytes 0 output 4)
     ;; bfOffBits = 54
     (push-bytes 54 output 4)
     ;; biSize = 40
     (push-bytes 40 output 4)
     ;; biWidth = width
     (push-bytes width output 4)
     ;; biHeight = height
     (push-bytes height output 4)
     ;; biPlanes = 1
     (push-bytes 1 output 2)
     ;; biBitCount = 32
     (push-bytes 32 output 2)

     (push-bytes 0 output 4)
     ;; biXPelsPerMeter = 0

     ;; biYPelsPerMeter = 0
     (push-bytes 0 output 4)
     ;; biClrUsed = 0
     (push-bytes 0 output 4)
     ;; biClrImportant = 0
     (push-bytes 0 output 4)
     ;; here starts the color channels in BGRA order
     ;; note that all rows must be padded with 0 to a multiple of four 
bytes
     ;; The rows are upside-down, so output the bottom row first
     (iter (for y below height)
       (iter (for x below width)
         (declare (type fixnum x y))
         (multiple-value-bind (r g b a)
             (get-pixel-chans self x (the fixnum (- height y 1)))

                 <pre>Hi Chris!

This won't work for me. I'm using the images in a poker client and
they make part of the installation package that people download. The
size of the package has to be as small as possible. Regardless, I
think I've found a solution in cl-jpeg. It's a pure lisp
implementation of JPEG encoding and decoding (about 70k source and
200k compiled). Take a look at these results:

(proclaim '(optimize (speed 3) 
    (safety 0) 
    (fixnum-safety 0) 
    (float 0)
    (debug 0)))

(load (compile-file "~/temp/cljl/jpeg"))
(time (jpeg:decode-image "~/temp/lobby.jpg"))

user time    =      0.570
system time  =      0.020
Elapsed time =   0:00:01
Allocation   = 5192260 bytes
4 Page faults

I particularly like the allocation (5mb as it should be) and the 4
page faults. Contrast that with the results from functions using CAPI.
The version above took about 5 seconds without the proclaim, i.e. with
default safety: 3, speed:1, etc.

I would still like to know if it's possible to optimize my original
CAPI version. Or is it that multiplying floats 430K times is just
supposed to be slow under LispWorks?
 
    Thanks, Joel

Are you sure you've compiled the functions?  This is what I get on my
machine (IBM Thinkpad with Pentium M 2.0 MHz, 1.5 GB RAM, LWW 4.4):

  CL-USER 19 &gt (time (image-&gtrgb pane image))
  Timing the evaluation of (IMAGE-&gtRGB PANE IMAGE)

  user time    =      9.263
  system time  =      0.050
  Elapsed time =   0:00:09
  Allocation   = 85528704 bytes standard / 14105476 bytes conses
  0 Page faults
  #&lt;Pointer to type (:UNSIGNED :CHAR) = #x0A4D0020&gt

  CL-USER 22 &gt (time (image-&gtrgb1 pane image))
  Timing the evaluation of (IMAGE-&gtRGB1 PANE IMAGE)

  user time    =      1.442
  system time  =      0.000
  Elapsed time =   0:00:01
  Allocation   = 85527432 bytes standard / 8481 bytes conses
  0 Page faults
  #&lt;Pointer to type (:UNSIGNED :CHAR) = #x0A610020&gt

That's a LOT faster, isn't it?  If you've really compiled the
functions then maybe you should get a real computer... :)

(Sorry, couldn't resist.)

Anyway, as another option you also might want to look into CL-GD and
do something like this (untested):

  (defun foo ()
    (let ((result))
      (with-image-from-file* (#p"c:/path/to/lobby.jpg")
        (do-pixels ()
          (let ((raw-pixel (raw-pixel)))
            ;; add declarations or use the new int32-xxx functions
            ;; in LW 4.4 to speed things up
            (push (ash (logand #xff0000 raw-pixel) -16) result)
            (push (ash (logand #xff00 raw-pixel) -8) result)
            (push (logand #xff raw-pixel) result))))
      (nreverse result)))

CL-GD is at &lt;http://weitz.de/cl-gd/&gt.

Cheers,
Edi.

&gt machine (IBM Thinkpad with Pentium M 2.0 MHz, 1.5 GB RAM, LWW 4.4):

Right, I did not have them compiled when running those first tests. I
also did not have optimizations on, I only have 512Mb of memory and
those gl-vectors get stuck in memory until you free them which is
something that I was not doing. I ended up killing LW when it took
3.49Gb of swap space.
 
&gt   CL-USER 22 &gt (time (image-&gtrgb1 pane image))
&gt   Timing the evaluation of (IMAGE-&gtRGB1 PANE IMAGE)
&gt 
&gt   user time    =      1.442
&gt   system time  =      0.000
&gt   Elapsed time =   0:00:01
&gt   Allocation   = 85527432 bytes standard / 8481 bytes conses
&gt   0 Page faults
&gt   #&lt;Pointer to type (:UNSIGNED :CHAR) = #x0A610020&gt

I'm extremely surprised that the version with array references did an
order of magnitude better for you than the version that just pushes
into a list. What do you think is the reason?
 
&gt Anyway, as another option you also might want to look into CL-GD and
&gt do something like this (untested):

Thanks for the tip. I got very good results (same 1s as above) using
CL-JPEG and discovered a few interesting bits that might be of help to
someone....

CL-JPEG returns the bytes in BGR order and the GL_BGR option is only
supported with OpenGL 1.2. You get OpenGL 1.1. on Windows and need to
install latest drivers for your graphics card to get 1.2. As I can't
expect people to have OpenGL 1.2. I would need to make a pass over
that array and swap the bytes to RGB which would be a performance hit
and a minus. A plus would be that I won't have to read a separate mask
file to get the alpha values as CL-JPEG can extract the alpha channel
from a JPEG. I have yet to time that but expect performance to be
decent.

About those pesky gl-vectors... They are not needed, really. In fact
there's an option in defsys.lisp that enables them and you can disable
it with

;; (pushnew :use-fli-gl-vector sys::*features*)

If you do then simple arrays are used and you don't have to free them
as the GC will do that for you. gl-vectors get mapped to the static
area so that they are not garbage collected but are simple arrays
otherwise. The list that I was collecting and then reversing in the
first example is only needed for initialize array elements and so is
an extra unnecessary operation.

Here's the kick, though... OpenGL can take arrays of bytes or integers
for each color channel, arrays of pixel values, etc. Ultimately the
channel values /that I was so meticulously converting to byte by
multiplying by 255/ get converted into... floats and so there's no
need to multiply them.

To summarize, you can use CAPI and the image access API to prepare
byte arrays for OpenGL textures. If you don't need the alpha channel
then you are set. If you do then you need to read in the mask image
and set each the alpha byte in your array.

Unfortunately for me that huge 794x538 lobby image is not unique as my
poker room images (carpet, table) are the same size and I don't want
to read and scan them twice. So I'll just keep in mind that CAPI float
color values are perfectly acceptable by OpenGL and stick to reading
4-channel JPEGs with CL-JPEG for the time being.

This has been a very educational day-long experience for me, although
I still don't understand how to properly optimize my code :-).

    Thanks, Joel

They actually _are_ needed and I'm getting good performance. I just
have to figure out this OpenGL thing and then I'll be done :).

The first version conses up a list, then reverses it, then throws it
away.  My gut feeling is that this /must/ be slower than the second
version unless single calls to GL-VECTOR-AREF are much more expensive
than filling the whole vector at once.
