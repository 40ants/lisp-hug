                <h1>Desperate plea for help: access to raw image data</h1>
                <pre>Folks,

I need to convert images stores as JPEG, BMP, etc. files to OpenGL
textures. I spent a few days trying to load my images using various
methods. According to the docs LispWorks uses image decoding libraries
internally and I would like to use this capability. I would be
duplicating code and introducing /perhaps/ unneeded dependencies if I
were to go with a C library and write my texture loading code in C.

To load a texture OpenGL expects an array of RGB, RGBA, etc. raw data.
The only way to create this data now is by using the gp:image-access
api, extract the individual pixels, unconvert the color and extract
the float color values. You will then need to either multiply the
color values by 255 when storing into a byte array or store them into
a float array.

I wrote code that uses CL-JPEG (CLJL, external JPEG decompressor
written in Lisp) to load my textures as well as code that uses the the
gp:image-access apis. I'm storing raw data into a float array. The
results in both cases are killing me. And I some of my images are BMP
so I'll need yet another decoder if I am to go with the faster
solution.

Take a look at these results but don't pay attention to the speed too
much. I was running iTunes to simulate normal machine load and had
lots of memory taken by a PDF viewer, web browser, etc. #1 takes 14x
more memory and runs almost 4 times slower than #2!

1. This is the version that uses gp:image-access apis

Timing the evaluation of (LOAD1 V)

user time    =      5.200
system time  =      0.050
Elapsed time =   0:00:07
Allocation   = 146926864 bytes
3976 Page faults

2. This is the version that uses CL-JPEG

Timing the evaluation of (LOAD2 V)

user time    =      2.100
system time  =      0.080
Elapsed time =   0:00:03
Allocation   = 10384964 bytes
4966 Page faults

The GP code that loads images from disk is very fast and all the time
is spent extracting pixels. How can I get hold of the raw image bytes
after loading the image? I assume that the GP apis need to store this
data someplace. Is there some kind of an undocumented function? I
would be in haven if there was and would, it's all I need and I that
I'm asking for!

    Thanks, Joel

                 <h1>Re: Desperate plea for help: access to raw image data</h1>
                 <pre>This is probably a question for Dave Fox but I thought others might be
interested in this as well...

Running 

(setf access (gp:make-image-access port image))
(class-direct-methods (class-of access))

Reveals

IMAGE-ACCESS-GET-ALL-PIXELS 
IMAGE-ACCESS-IMAGE

Running

(gp::image-access-image access)

I get on Mac OSX:

#&lt;Pointer: OBJC:OBJC-OBJECT-POINTER = #x0039E590&gt

And on Windows XP:

#S(GRAPHICS-PORTS::DIB-SECTION :HBITMAP 100992228 :BITMAP-INFO
#S(GRAPHICS-PORTS::DIB-INFO :-OFF-BITS NIL :INFO-SIZE NIL :WIDTH 794
:HEIGHT 538 :PLANES 1 :BIT-COUNT 32 :COMPRESSION NIL :SIZE-IMAGE
1708688 X-PELS-PER-METER NIL :Y-PELS-PER-METER NIL :CLR-USED NIL
:CLR-IMPORTANT NIL :TYPE NIL) :BITS #&lt;Pointer to type :BYTE =
#x01800000&gt :COLOR-DATA NIL)

OSX: 

(gp::image-access-get-all-pixels access)
#&lt;Function 5 subfunction of (METHOD
GRAPHICS-PORTS::%MAKE-IMAGE-ACCESS-REPRESENTATION (T
GRAPHICS-PORTS::COCOA-IMAGE-REPRESENTATION T T T))&gt

Windows XP:

#&lt;closure (SUBFUNCTION 2 (METHOD
GRAPHICS-PORTS::%MAKE-IMAGE-ACCESS-REPRESENTATION (T T T T T)))
214904B2&gt

I'm willing to sacrifice some cross-platform portability for the sake
of not having to write extra C image loading code. It seems to me that
one should be able to either get hold of the raw data through
image-access-image or by calling the get-all-pixels closure.

Dave, any suggestions here?

    Thanks in advance, Joel

If you want to hunt for undocumented functions, you can use the apropos 
function:

(apropos "image" :gp)

Of course, this is not the best approach since the functions may change 
or be completely gone in future releases.

You might want to investigate to see if there are functions in the 
standard Mac and Windows API to do what you want via the FLI. I'm sure 
you'll find something in quicktime for the Mac, but I'm not certain 
about Windows.

                 <pre>Dave,

I just emailed you all the code as well as the JPEGs. It's taking me 5
seconds to load a 367K image, 60K image and a 72K image. I really want
to get that down to a second.

Overall, it seems particularly inefficient to have to copy from a
foreign array (or similar as I'm sure your image data is represented)
into another foreign array for OpenGL which will then copy it into yet
another foreign array internally. I really thought better of Lisp
compilers.

This is my code, in case someone on the list has any tips:

(defun load-sprite (port image mask)
  (let ((image-access (gp:make-image-access port image))
	(mask-access (gp:make-image-access port mask)))
    (unwind-protect
	 (let* ((width (gp:image-access-width image-access))
		(height (gp:image-access-height image-access))
		(tw (* width 4)))
	   (gp:image-access-transfer-from-image image-access)
	   (gp:image-access-transfer-from-image mask-access)
	   (opengl:with-gl-vectors ((data :type :single-float 
					  :length (* tw height)))
	     (declare #.*optimize*
		      (type fixnum tw width height)
		      (type gp:image image mask)
		      (type gp::image-access image-access mask-access))
	     ;; copy color channels and insert alpha
	     (loop for y fixnum from 0 below height
		for ty fixnum from 0 by tw do
		  (loop for x fixnum from 0 below width
		     for tx fixnum from ty by 4 
		     for tr fixnum = tx 
		     for tg fixnum = (1+ tr)
		     for tb fixnum = (1+ tg)
		     for ta fixnum = (1+ tb) do
		       (let* ((pixel (gp:image-access-pixel image-access x y))
			      (color (color:unconvert-color port pixel))
			      (mask-pixel (gp:image-access-pixel mask-access x y))
			      (mask-color (color:unconvert-color port mask-pixel))
			      )
			 (setf (opengl:gl-vector-aref data tr) 
			       (color:color-red color))
			 (setf (opengl:gl-vector-aref data tg) 
			       (color:color-green color))
			 (setf (opengl:gl-vector-aref data tb) 
			       (color:color-blue color))
			 (setf (opengl:gl-vector-aref data ta) 
			       (color:color-red mask-color))
			 )))
	     ;; build our texture mipmaps
	     (opengl:glu-build2-dmipmaps opengl:*gl-texture-2d* 
					 4 width height

					 opengl:*gl-float*

	   (opengl:gl-enable opengl:*gl-texture-2d*))

                 <h1>Re: Desperate plea for help: access to raw image data</h1>
                 <pre>Folks,

Here's the answer: 

http://wagerlabs.com/tech/2005/01/i-feel-need-need-for-speed.html

I was willing to sacrifice some cross-platform portability and I got a
fast solution. I can now load and process 3 JPEGs (367K, 72K and 60K)
in 1 second and using only 530K of memory:

user time    =      0.860
system time  =      0.120
Elapsed time =   0:00:01
Allocation   = 534208 bytes
8091 Page faults

The CAPI/Image access result was 7-12 seconds and 146Mb of memory.
The JPEG decoder (CL-JL) results were 5-7 seconds and 10Mb of memory.

Another advantage is that I'll get the same speed regardless of the
type of image that I'm processing and I can process any image that
CAPI supports. The disadvantage is that I'll have to write a custom
bit of code for Windows and X.

I'm not bothered a lot since the LispWorks OpenGL API already has
custome code for OSX, Windows and X. Plus, there's not a lot of code
to write.

Here's a Mac OSX/Cocoa solution to retrieving raw image data after
using CAPI to decode the image:

(setf temp (gp:read-external-image filename))
(setf image (gp:load-image port temp :force-plain t))
(setf access (gp:make-image-access port image))

;; don't try this at home!

(setf cocoa-image (gp::image-access-image access)) ;; undocumented

(defun cocoa-get-image-bytes (image)
  (let ((bitmap (objc:invoke 
		 (objc:invoke "NSBitmapImageRep" "alloc") 
		 "initWithData:" 
		 (objc:invoke image "TIFFRepresentation"))))
    (if bitmap
	(let ((bytes (objc:invoke-into 
		     '(:pointer (:unsigned :char))
		     bitmap "bitmapData")))
	  (values bitmap bytes))
	nil)))

I'm returning the bitmap as well since I need to deallocate it after I'm done:

(defun cocoa-free-image-bytes (bitmap)
  (objc:invoke bitmap "release"))

Kudos to the LispWorks folks for having the Objective-C API and
helping me cast the return from [bitmap bitmapData] with that
invoke-into bit.

    Joel
