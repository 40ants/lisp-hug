                <h1>Delivery: Undefined function RETURN</h1>
                <pre>Hi!

I have an application that works fine at delivery level 0 but has
strange problems at higher levels.  I get the error

  Undefined function RETURN called with arguments ("").

at delivery level 3 which surprised me a bit.  Then I thought that
maybe all invocations of RETURN might have been optimized away somehow
so I added CL:RETURN to the list of symbols to keep.  Now the error
changed to

  No block NIL outstanding.

I checked all appearances of RETURN but I'm pretty sure all of them
are enclosed in some NIL block.  And, as I said, the application works
fine at level 0 anyway.

Any idea how to find out what's causing these problems?

Thanks,
Edi.

I suggest ensuring that all the code with RETURN occurrences is compiled.
