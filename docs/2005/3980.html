 Thanks , this works - with exactly the same problems John DeSoi describes -
 labels take on wrong background colour,
 transparency in button images is rendered as black etc. I'll try to fix it
 somehow (if anyone did, please share the method).

 Denis.

I never found a way to fix it. On my preferences dialog, I just made 
the group box pane background color the same (wrong) color as the 
labels. It looks a little goofy, but it is not a major interface for 
the application.

On a related topic, I'm trying to figure out how to make disabled 
toolbar buttons look better on Windows. The default algorithm basically 
just blanks out the colored area which looks really bad except for very 
simple outline type icons. I would also like to add the option for text 
labels -- something similar to Internet Explorer. Anyone already tacked 
this with the fli?

I thought about this today and searched Google a bit.  Right now my
understanding is that

a) this "manifest trick" will only get you the XP look and feel if you
   (i.e. the user of a delivered LW app) have the .NET runtime
   installed, and

b) at least some of the glitches described above are due to bugs in
   old .NET versions which are supposed to be fixed in 2.0.

See for example this article:

  &lt;http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/dotnetvisualstyles.asp&gt

Checking whether my assumptions are correct would require me to remove
and/or update the .NET framework on the only XP machine that I have
and I can't do that right now due to other projects.  I might install
XP on VMWare one of these days just to check but maybe someone else
can already confirm or refute my guesses.  Specifically:

a) Will adding a manifest file as described by John DeSoi give you XP
   look and feel if you don't have .NET installed?

b) Do (some of) the problems reported by John and Denis vanish if you
   use .NET 2.0?

Thanks,
Edi.

&gt Yes, I'm pretty sure it does. See this article:

&gt vbtchUsingWindowsXPVisualStylesWithControlsOnWindowsForms.asp

Thanks, I stand corrected.  FWIW, I now found this article which
explains the underlying mechanism a bit (see "Side-by-side Assembly
Sharing"):

  &lt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/01/11/XPOver/&gt

&gt As a work-around, I still think it might be possible to get the
&gt correct color from the system and use it to setup the labels so they
&gt look right. I was not able to figure it out, but maybe some one who
&gt is more of a Windows guru would have better luck.

So, question to LispWorks:

Would it be possible to fix the outstanding issues as paid support
incidents such that delivered Windows apps plus manifest file are
fully "themable" in XP?

Thanks,
Edi.
