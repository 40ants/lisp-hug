                <h1>Setting up "hideable" panes in a layout</h1>
                <pre>Hi

What would be the best way to have a column (row) layout with one e 
hideabl component?
Would you just muck with LAYOUT-DESCRIPTION at run time?

Thanks
Marco

Take a look at capi:switchable-layout (s).  You can "hide" the component 
in a layer
of this kind of layout.

I suppose that depends on what should happen when you hide the component.
If it's contained in another layout, should it collapse or should it keep
its previous size?

For simple cases, you could probably just use HIDE-PANE.

But I would be inclined to use DEFINE-LAYOUT and friends (INTERPRET-DESCRIPTION,
CALCULATE-CONSTRAINTS and CALCULATE-LAYOUT) to create a new layout class
that behaves exactly the way you want it to.

&gt Would you just muck with LAYOUT-DESCRIPTION at run time?

As opposed to at compile time, you mean?  (Just kidding ;-)

Sure, I think mucking with LAYOUT-DESCRIPTION is OK.  I'd feel a bit more
comfortable when doing this with a layout-class that I defined myself.
But maybe that's more defensive than necessary.
