                <pre>
Is there a way to draw charts (scatter plots, bar charts, and the
like) in Lispworks?  If you know of a good solution, please send a
pointer.

Thanks!

Chris Dean

                 <pre>Chris,

if you have the Enterprise version, I would recommend looking into the COM
interface to Excel.  You can send data, invoke functions, create excel
objects, run macros with that which would give you all you're asking.  The
interface is not trivial, but straightforward.

Thanks!  That's a great idea, but unfortunately I run on Linux and

There's nothing "builtin" available. However there do exist a few
packages which may of help 
cl-dot http://www.cliki.net/cl-dot
cl-pdf http://www.cliki.net/CL-PDF

Of course you can use the drawing primitives from CAPI also.

&gtWhat about invoking gnuplot ( http://www.gnuplot.info/ ) ?

And what about using Foil and some SWT libraries?  :-)

&gt
&gtThis is a rather attractive solution, provided that you decide 
&gtto have your UI built completely in Java.
&gt
&gtI may be wrong, but I don't see how to do
&gt
&gt         (capi:define-interface foo () ()
&gt            (:panes
&gt               (l1 foil-swt-pane ....))

You are right. However in some application, using both 
technologies side by side could be conceivable (e.g., if what is 
needed is just display charts).

In addition to the pointers others have given CL-GD might also be an
option:
