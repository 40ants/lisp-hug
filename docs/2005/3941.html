&gt Subject: check-type doesn't eval for restart?
&gt 
&gt Hi all, say I've got the following code:
&gt 
&gt 
&gt (defstruct foo )
&gt 
&gt (defun bar (f)
&gt   (check-type f foo)
&gt   'nothing-else-to-do)
&gt 
&gt (bar nil)
&gt 
&gt When (bar nil) is run, I get the expected error that f isn't of the
&gt correct type,
&gt and that I can supply a new value. When I choose that restart, I get a
&gt dialog
&gt in which I can enter a form 'to be evaluated'. If I enter (make-foo),
the
&gt error still occurs with the value (make-foo) is not of type foo. It
seems
&gt that
&gt the form is not actually being evaluated, merely read. This would seem
&gt to be a bug. It it, or am I misunderstanding the restart? I'm on LWM
4.4.5.
&gt Thanks!

[BWM ] I just tried this under Windows 4.4.5 personal and Mac
professional, and it worked fine on both. (make-foo) immediately returned
the last form of bar.
Are you running a different configuration? Did you try not loading your
init file?

                 <pre>Ah, well, I tried without the init file, and while I doubt that made a
difference,
I found something that did:

Am I correct in my guess that you ran those forms in a listener? When I ran
them in a listener, I encountered no problems. Try executing that last form
via Ctrl-X Ctrl-E, so that the dialog for the form comes up in a capi prompt. 
That is the case in which I get the error.
