                <h1>Decoding an int32 from a part of a sequence</h1>
                <pre>
Hello,

I am looking for an elegant and efficient way of reading a 32 bits 
integer (big endian) from a specificed location in a sequence of bytes.

I have searched for solutions but those I have found were not elegant, 
or required to copy a part of the sequence.

Thank you in advance for your suggestions.


Best Regards,
Camille

There's no need to copy anything.

(defun uint32-ref (vector offset)
  (the (unsigned-byte 32)
       (dpb (aref vector offset) (byte 8  24)
            (dpb (aref vector (1+ offset)) (byte 8  16)
                 (dpb (aref vector (+ 2 offset)) (byte 8  8) 
                      (aref vector (+ 3 offset)))))))
 
(defun int32-ref (vector offset)
  (let ((u (uint32-ref vector offset)))
    ;; do you want two-complement?
    (if (zerop (ldb (byte 1 31) u))
        u
        (- u (expt 2 32)))))

&gt HI all,
&gt
&gt I ran a benchmark comparing the DPB approach vs an arithmetic one I've
&gt used, benchmark &amp; code follows.  The results suggest the arithmetic
&gt approach may be faster w/ smaller memory footprint in some
&gt circumstances.  The performance difference follows reversing the order
&gt of the tests and with dataset lengths up to 2x10^6.  (only one test
&gt shown below).  Would be interesting if others find a similar result,
&gt or not.

&gt      (* #x00000100 (aref dblock 2))
&gt      (aref dblock 3)) )

It shouldn't make a difference with a not-dumb compiler, but:

 (defun gm-uint32-ref (dblock)
   (+ (ash (aref dblock 0) 24)
      (ash (aref dblock 1) 16)
      (ash (aref dblock 2)  8)
           (aref dblock 3)))


Then, depending on the strength of the compiler on types,  the following
might be even faster (notice that processor can OR faster than ADD
usually, because they don't have to check for carries)

(defun gm-uint32-ref (dblock) 
 (logand #xffffffff
   (logior (ash (aref dblock 0) 24)
           (ash (aref dblock 1) 16)
           (ash (aref dblock 2)  8)
                (aref dblock 3))))


The logand is actually a type declaration, a good compiler should do the
same with it as with (the (unsigned-byte 32) ...).
But again, I'd expect a good compiler to generate the same code from dpb
as from logior+ash.


So there, you have a few more options to benchmark.
