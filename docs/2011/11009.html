Hello,

My modification to a major application manages to get itself to a spot
where it automatically stops multiprocessing (the reason for that
stopping is currently unknown).  It might be okay that it stops
multiprocessing, however the following message prevents the
application from running in a multi-threaded manner.  When I try to
re-initialize-multiprocessing, I get the following error message:

;; No live processes except internal servers - stopping multiprocessing


I'm somewhat stuck and would appreciate any information people could
contribute.  I checked to make sure that *initial-processes* hadn't
been set to nil or something bogus, and it was what I guessed it
should be (by reading the initialize-multiprocessing documentation).
An Internet search for 'lispworks "no live processes"' didn't yield
any results.  So, I thought I would ask whether someone else has seen
this problem, and how they might have fixed it.

Thanks,
David
