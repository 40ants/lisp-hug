                <h1>Hi</h1>
                <pre>Hi

Just wondering if anyone has (or had) experience with LISP code for controlling a robotic arm?

I am in the process of building an autonomous robot, using LISP and have been fairly successful thus far.\

It has AI, speech recognition and response, vision, emotions, can interface to several sensors and moves around by itself.

I am up to the point where I want to add an arm or two.  

Any help would be great as I am still only learning LISP.

Thanks

Hello,

My university lab has used various things to control a SCORBOT ER IX
and a three fingered hand made by Barrett as part of a Psychometric AI
program [1].  There's also a cognitive robotics labs in the department
[2] and they have a number of robot arms as well (not SCORBOTs, but
something smaller.  I don't know how they're controlling them though.

I haven't personally worked with the robot, but I think there have
been two approaches — one was to write the foreign function interface
for the C/C++ library API that came with the robot.  The other used a
pipe to communicate with an interactive shell that the robot provides.

I haven't been particularly involved with either of these programs,
and the SCORBOT isn't seeing much use right now, but I can try to put
you in touch with people who might know more it, and also with people
in the cognitive robotics lab if you'd like.
