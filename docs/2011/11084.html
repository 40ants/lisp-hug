                <h1>Unit Testing Any?</h1>
                <pre>Hello,

My project is using ASDF for system definitions and LIFT for unit-testing.

I would like to know if some of you are using this combo and if you have some hints to share.  For example, what is your workflow?  When and how do you load an ASDF file?  Do you use the ASDF extension to LispWorks?

More specifically, I am looking for a way to launch the tests with the keyboard, so I can test along while writing the code.


Best,
Cam

I've never used Lift, but I usually put unit tests in a separate package and asdf system. When testing I'll load this and run a function that activates the test runner on all the tests. It can be setup mostly the same as you'ld use for example JUnit elsewhere.

Maybe you'll want to set up something in order to run your tests in a separate image.


Kind regards
