                <h1>how much clear code should be clear</h1>
                <pre>
Hello -

When I write code I try to write clear code. But the clearness of code is a very subjective term. Sometimes in the pursuit of clearness it feels like creating a clear mess at the end.

For example, here is a code to convert an utf8 array of bytes into a LW string:
http://paste.lisp.org/display/126511

It works for its intended use despite the fact that it has flaws; also it is fast enough in comparison with native functions from the external-format package. Being fast speed ups the code where it is used.

Not so long ago I again needed the code to convert from utf8 bytes to lisp strings with slight modifications in requirements. The code above looked and felt like being not clear so I rewrote it. Now it is like this:
http://paste.lisp.org/display/126512

It works. But there are much more code now. Also the new code is about 1.8 times slower that the original code, and when I sprinkle the original code with optimize directives the new code would be 2-2.5 times slower. Because I use both codes in a web application server, being fast means some additional requests per second. But it is still considerable faster on my data than functions from the external-format package.


Questions: 1) when you look at those pieces of code, what do you perceive as a clean/bad code? 2) how do you keep your lisp code clean and clear? 3) how do you know when to stop clearing code? or not clear at all?

Best,
 Art

I personally find the first implementation clearer than the second -
the code can be read in a linear fashion, while the second requires me
to read, understand and memorize a number of smaller functions before
I can understand the main function.

I had need of a similar function some time back; a slightly modified
version of my code is added as an annotation to your first paste. With
similar declarations, my code appars to be about 60% slower than yours
(1000 calls using a test string that contains 10000 repetitions of
"this is a test: æøåÆØÅ" takes about 25s with your code, and 40s with
my code).

I took the first piece of code from the project where that function is peppered with:

(declare (optimize (speed 3) (safety 0) (debug 0) (float 0)))
(declare (type (simple-array (unsigned-byte 8) (*)) buf))

and only arrays of the (simple-array (unsigned-byte 8) (*)) type are processed by the function. In this case it is faster.

But I don't like (declare). It's like a voodoo magic. So nowadays I try to refrain from (declare) with types and optimization options.

 Art

In this case hcl:fixnum-safety can also help. But IME one should be really careful with that and only use it in very controlled places.

The only thing I do not like with them is, that they make the code  more complicated and more difficult to read. I refrain from declarations most of the time and for most of the code I write too. I use them when I encounter real performance problems, which are not solvable by a restructuring of code or the use of different functions and algorithms. For computationally intensive code I also did work with custom packages, which shadowed certain CL symbols to provide functions and macros that handled the necessary declarations for my problem domain automatically for me. This enables very readable though at the same time very optimized domain code.

cheers,
Jochen

That seems quite good.
I would only recommend defining *utf8-tail-lengths* with :element-type
'(unsigned-byte 8).

If you do need it very optimized, rewrite the code using the system:int32-
function family.

I tried and saw no significant gain in that. Actually, fixnum is also not of a big help there (if any).

I don't like it. The whole int32- family looks strange to me. Right now I'm of an opinion that if I ever think of int32- I'd better turn to c/asm through the ffi interface.

One day I wondered how int32- was added to LW. My guess was that it started as a custom feature request to LW guys from some company and was added permanently later. But that was just a wild guess, as I said I was just wondering. :)

Several years ago I had solve a similar problem.  I decided to use
Dick Waters series
package.  This allowed me to factor the code into a nice set of
abstractions that was
easy to work with.  The downside was a couple of truly horrific
procedures that took
care of the mismatch between the variable length unicode representations and the
fixed width representations.  In any case, this is what the top level
code looked like:

(defun utf-8-&gtucs-2 (ustring)
  "Convert a ustring to a lw:text-string."
  (collect 'string
           (#m code-char
               (ucs-4-&gtucs-2
                (utf-8-&gtucs-4
                 (scan 'simple-vector-8b
                       (code-unit-vector ustring)))))))

Which I think is really easy to read.

The definition of ucs-4-&gtucs-2 was simple as well:

(defun ucs-4-&gtucs-2 (ucs-4-series)
  "Series transducer that maps unicode extension characters
   into the unicode replacement character."
  (declare (optimizable-series-function)
           (type (series ucs-4-code) ucs-4-series))
  (map-fn 'ucs-2-code (lambda (code)
                        (declare (type ucs-4-code code))
                        (if (&lt;= code #xFFFF)
                            code
                            #xFFFD)) ;; unicode replacement char
          ucs-4-series))

The hard part was transducing utf-8 to ucs-4.  For this I needed a
series macro that
allows you to `look ahead' several elements in the series:

(defmacro scan-ahead (series bindings default &amp;body body)
  "Binds variables in BINDINGS to the series, the series displaced by one,
   the series displaced by two, etc.  In effect, allows a fixed amount of
   lookahead for the body.  The value of default is used to `pad out' the
   tail of the series and will appear as the value of the last elements
   near the end.  Example:

   (scan-ahead #z(foo bar baz quux) (a b c) 'xyzzy  ....)

   will bind A to the series #z(foo bar baz quux)
             B to the series #z(bar baz quux xyzzy) and
             C to the series #z(baz quux xyzzy xyzzy)"
  (let ((n (length bindings)))
    `(MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND ,bindings
         (CHUNK ,n 1 (CATENATE ,series (SUBSERIES (SERIES ,default) 1 ,n)))
      ,@body)))

This is used to peek ahead in the utf-8 octet series.  Then we need a
transducing macro
that takes the multiple series generated above and produces the output
series.  It does
a small code-walk to destructure a literal lambda expression.  This
gives the illusion that
it is a simple function that takes a functional argument:

(defmacro decode-series (series &amp;key (padding nil) decoder (arity nil))
  "DECODER must be a literal lambda expression with only REQUIRED args.
   The decoder is invoked in turn on each overlapping n-tuple (where n
   is the number of args) in the series.  The decoder should return
   two values:  the decoded value and a `skip' count.  The decoded value
   is placed in the output followed by `skip' copies of PADDING.
  "
  (destructure-function-lambda
   arity decoder
   (lambda (bindings docstring decls body)
     (declare (ignore docstring decls))
     (with-unique-names (output-code count)
       `(SCAN-AHEAD ,series ,bindings ,padding
          (MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND (,output-code ,count)
            (COLLECTING-FN '(VALUES T FIXNUM)
                           (LAMBDA () (VALUES ,padding 0))
                           (LAMBDA (,output-code ,count ,@bindings)
                             (IF (&gt ,count 0)
                                 (VALUES ,padding (1- ,count))
                                 (PROGN ,@body)))
                           ,@bindings)
            ,output-code))))
   (lambda () (error "Literal lambda needed for decode-series."))))

Now that's an ugly macro.  However, it isn't just useful for decoding unicode.
   Example:  Decode the %nn parts of a URI.

   (decode-series uri-characters
     :padding #\null
     :decoder (lambda (c0 c1 c2)     ;; lookahead by two characters
                (if (char/= c0 #\%)
                    (values c0 0)    ;; if not a %, pass it through
                    ;; Otherwise, decode the following characters,
                    ;; and return that value.  Use #\NULL for next two
                    ;; outputs.
                    (values (+ (* (digit-char-p c1 16) 16) (digit-char-p c2 16))
                             2))))

The performance was pretty good, if I recall.  The series package
code-walks all these
forms and turns utf-8-&gtucs-2 into a huge tagbody that is quite efficient.

Abstraction.  Always look for a way to separate the problem into
simple building blocks.
In this case, the series abstraction was the natural mechanism.
