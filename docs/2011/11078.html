                <h1>define-loop-method and friends in LW 6</h1>
                <pre>
Hi,

I have LWL6 Pro. version. and like to know about define-loop-method
and its friends (for defining user extensions to the loop macro).

It is exported from Lispworks package, however, I tried to find doc
using the menu On Symbol with no chance. There is doc for these method
at the following link (I assume LispWorks 5, from the link):

http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lcl50/loop/loop-52.html.

fast scanning through the release notes of version 6 revealed nothing
(searching for deprecation hint).

Is it still supported in LispWorks?

Regards,

- Ala'a

This is not LispWorks 5, but Lucid Common Lisp (LCL) 5, a legacy platform supported by LW.
