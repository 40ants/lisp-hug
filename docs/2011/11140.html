Has anyone tried running LispWorks version 5.1.x on OS X 10.7 Lion? I'm sort of afraid to upgrade to the new OS, mainly for this reason.

Cheers,
JD

Hi,

may be I drop a note although I use LispWorks 6.1 and not 5.1 for the Mac.

I have brought my current project to an iMac, a MacBook and to a  
MacBook Air, each with Mac OS 10.7 (upgraded from 10.6.8) and don't  
experience any problems or difficulties (until now). As far as I  
understand the new features brought with 10.7, I make the experience  
that they work with LispWorks 6.1. Attention: I have _not_ made  
extended tests!!

Greetings
Max

It doesn't appear to work properly. Launching the 5.1 app bundle failed for me; more specifically, it opened a Terminal window containing the following text, and then progressed no further:

Last login: Fri Jul 22 16:42:24 on ttys000
cairagor:~ mikel$ /tmp/LWtemp.cairagor.23295.1.command ; exit;

("cairagor" is my hostname).


Getting rid of my init files and Lispworks config files yielded no improvement.

A console image that I previously saved launches fine, and appears, on cursory examination, to work properly, but if I try to start the IDE environment, this happens:

CL-USER 3 &gt (env:start-environment)

Error: Signal A [code 0] at 9AF414B1 {inside foreign code}
eax   16A220 ; ebx BFFFDF2C ; ecx        3 ; edx        3
esp BFFFDE70 ; ebp BFFFDE88 ; esi 9AF4147C ; edi        0
  1 (continue) Ignore the error.
  2 (abort) Destroy interface "LispWorks" and its representation.
  3 Return to level 0.
  4 Restart top-level loop.

Type :b for backtrace, :c &lt;option number&gt to proceed,  or :? for other options

CL-USER 4 : 1 &gt 


So, at the very least, one person's Lispworks 5.1 fails to work on Lion.

&gt Which version of Mac OS X were you running before?

10.6.8.

No. I mistakenly believed that I had. It seems that the copy of Lispworks I have on the machine in question is 5.0.2 (!)

My apologies to anyone I may have misled.
