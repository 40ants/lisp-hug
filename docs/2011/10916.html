A question (or two):

Would Nick's issue be considered a bug or simply what happens with rounding (since pixel's are integral)?

Yes, that is a hack to get around it.

We will have this working much better for the next release.

Before anyone asks, we're not publishing a release date or feature list for LispWorks 6.1 yet.

Until then I have been using the workaround that Erik suggests - supersampling.

It isn't clear, because the underlying drawing operations on the Mac use
floating point anyway, so we are currently converting from real to integer and
back to float.

We will still support the existing integer-based drawing as an option, so the
performance of that will remain the same.

&gt &gt    Well, if you draw a non-horizontal non-vertical line, you get anti-
&gt &gt    aliasing, which means that most of the pixels drawn are semi-
&gt &gt    transparent. So if I draw from (0, 0) to (1, 100), I get a line
&gt &gt    that is mostly "between" the pixel grid.
&gt&gt  
&gt &gt Fwiw, I don't see that at all. 

&gt That is because the current drawing code on Windows doesn't do anti-aliasing, whereas it does on the Mac.

Hmmm ... I would have expected both to be the same for consistent results.

And, fwiw, a standard draw line function ought be NOT anti-aliased, IMHO. Then, users have a choice to roll their own if they want ... *and* different functions can be provided for anti-aliased line drawing too.

So, what is the plan for the future release you mentioned?

It's the behavior on OS X, but not on Windows.

We didn't do that because it made it look like a Mac OS 9 application :-)

capi:output-pane etc will have two modes, "compatible" and "quality", controlled by an initarg.

The compatible mode will be the same as now.

The quality mode will support alpha blending, anti-aliasing (which can be disabled), subpixel coordinates and arbitrary transforms for all drawing operations (currently, ellipses and text are not transformed).  We are leaning towards making "quality" be the default because all of the supported platforms are moving to that style of drawing.
