                <h1>Using both a restart function and multiprocessing when saving an image</h1>
                <pre>
Greetings Lispworks Community,

Is there a way to save an image with :multiprocessing t and also a
:restart-function, so that when the restart-function exits,
multiprocessing remains enabled?

The log included below the signature shows how multiprocessing exits,
even when I didn't ask for it to stop (I assume this is because
my-loop was called in a separate thread, and since that thread exited,
the system thinks that multiprocessing is no longer needed, which
isn't the case in our application).  I'm looking for the "right way"
to keep multiprocessing enabled, even after "my-loop" exits.  I
include a longer version of this question after the log.

Thank you,
David

=== Longer version of the question ===

I have an experimental modification to ACL2 that allows the main proof
process of ACL2 to evaluate in parallel.  ACL2 contains a
read-eval-print-loop.  Thus far our system has been designed for CCL
and SBCL, which have compile-time options for enabling
multiprocessing.  Lispworks has a similar option for when one saves
the image.  However, it's still possible to "return from"
multiprocessing once you start that image.  This ability to exit the
multi-processing loop without explicitly typing
"mp::stop-multiprocessing" is problematic for us.

So, I'm looking into a new implementation of our multi-threading for
Lispworks, which is based off the multi-processing example in the
Lispworks manual
[http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw60/LW/html/lw-287.htm#pgfId-890248].
 We have a function, "lp", which, when called, causes the prompt to
enter the ACL2 read-eval-print-loop.  So, I've renamed "lp" to "lp1"
and added the following Lispworks code:

(defvar *acl2-repl-thread*
 '("acl2-read-eval-print-loop" nil lp1))

(defun guarantee-process ()
 (unless mp::*multiprocessing*
   (pushnew *acl2-repl-thread*
            mp:*initial-processes*)
   (mp:initialize-multiprocessing)))

And then upon saving the image, I set the restart function to
"guarantee-process".

My question is: is there another way?  I still have to define "lp" to
call "lp1", and I'd like to avoid having to rename "lp" itself to
"lp1".  Based on an earlier thread, there isn't a way to disable the
"return from multiprocessing" option.

Hi Martin and Nick,

Calling lw:start-tty-listener is very close to what I was looking for.
 Thus far it seems nearly impossible to return from multiprocessing
when I do this (I'm guessing that I could interrupt "The idle process"
with a function that causes an error, and return that way, but I
haven't tried).

To answer Nick's question: having multiprocessing quit when there
aren't any more processes isn't necessarily a bad thing for us.  Our
problem lies in when we want to reinitialize-multiprocessing.  One
pretty much has to use a solution similar to the example found in
section 15.3 of the LW6 manual, where you need to spawn a thread each
time you want to reenter "my-loop."  Otherwise any time you call
mp:initialize-multiprocessing from within a function that is also
supposed to call "my-loop", "my-loop" is never entered.

Anyway, problem solved for now.

Thanks!
David

&gt If you want it to run a normal REPL, then you could call lw:start-tty-listener
