                <h1>Is there a way to have a tcp stream being interpreted as utf-8?</h1>
                <pre>
Hello,

I'm creating a tcp connection between two programs, one of which is
written in Lispworks. I'm writing s-expressions on the stream from the
"other" program, and Lispworks READs this and then evals it. This
works fine with one exception: the "other" program uses utf-8 and
Lispworks converts each byte to a character, which causes some
characters to be incorrect. I was looking for something like
:external-format which deals with this for files, but havent'
succeeded.

Does anyone know how to achieve this?


Thanks,

Kristoffer Kvello

I'm, not sure if that would work, but have you tried to first read-sequence on the input stream, then call:

(external-format:decode-external-string sequence :utf-8)

Which will return a lisp string, with the proper encoding interpretation.  You can then turn the string into a sexp using read-from-string.

The remaining problem with the TCP stream is that you may receive only a part of the sexp if both programs are running on different network locations.  If both are on the localhost, then you're fine.


Best Regards,
Camille

I use the following in certain cases where I have a string that has
been treated as a direct 8-bit encoding, but should have been utf-8.
Supplied under the "Both-Parts Licence": if it breaks (or is already
broken), you get to keep both parts :-)

An alternative might be to use external-forma:decode-external string
(as Camille suggests), or using flexi-streams:octets-to-styring and
flexi-streams:string-to-octets, but my testing indicates that the code
below is noticeably faster (or, if not "noticeably", then at least
"measurably").

(defun reinterpret-string-as-utf8 (string)

where the source data has been interpreted as an 8-bit (direct)
encoding - e.g, :latin-1, but should have been interpreted as :utf-8."

Thanks so much both of you! I got a tip to use Flexistreams, and I've
just concluded that this library solves my problem with almost no need
to modify my code. So I thank you too, Edi!

(I ended up taking the tcp stream (which is binary) and creating an
utf-8 flexistream from it and then simply passing that on.)
