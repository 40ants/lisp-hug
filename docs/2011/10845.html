                <h1>LW 6.0 delivery apps and App Store compatibility</h1>
                <pre>
Dear Lispworks,

I assume that in order to submit a binary for the App Store, it will need the
same treatment as an iPhone deliverable (code signing, proper certificates
and provisioning files, etc.)

Will this be addressed in a future release ?
If not, would it be possible to bundle a LW delivered binary within a stub
app (developed and signed with Xcode) which runs the LW binary as a
new process ?

Just wondering, but maybe it's not that relevant for LW based OS X apps.

Best regards,
Walantis

I certainly think it's relevant. I would use Lispworks for App Store apps if it were convenient to do so.

I imagine you can do something with Lispworks that is analogous to what you can do with something like Gambit Scheme: package the major functionality of your app as a library and make an XCode project that links to the library. Then use XCode in the normal way to submit your app to the App Store.
