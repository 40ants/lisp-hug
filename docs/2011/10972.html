                <pre>
Hello,

for some reason, I would like to disable the garbage collector of LispWorks, permanently for a given session (I mean not only for a given function call, but generally). I found gc-off somewhere but I can figure out how to use it. Could somebody please help me ?

Thank you,

Sascha Van Cauwelaert

Perhaps just call (hcl:avoid-gc)

Hi,

In case someone is looking for a quick answer for the 64-bit case in
the future (and also in hopes that someone will correct me if my
solution is wrong), I set a "high GC threshold" of 2 gigabytes using
the following:

    (system:set-blocking-gen-num 3 :gc-threshold (expt 2 31))
    (system:set-blocking-gen-num 2 :gc-threshold (expt 2 31))
    (system:set-blocking-gen-num 1 :gc-threshold (expt 2 31))
    (system:set-blocking-gen-num 0 :gc-threshold (expt 2 31))

Thanks,
David

&gt Thank you for your quick answer but I would really like to find how to disable it totally (maybe with gc-off ?)

The gc-threshold doesn't cause generation 0 to expand so those settings don't
stop gc -- in fact they might cause more gc, because it will never promote
from 0 to 1.

We recommend you try

(system:set-blocking-gen-num 0 :do-gc nil)

You can use hcl:extended-time to see how much time is spent in gc.
