                <h1>Unable to terminate a child process on Windows</h1>
                <pre>
Hello,

On Windows, I would like to know if sys:open-pipe sets the 
PROCESS_TERMINATE flag when calling OpenProcess.

It seems child processes I spawn using sys:open-pipe do not respond to 
termination events.  I need a way to signal child processes and stop via 
system calls.


Best Regards,
Camille

                 <h1>Re: Unable to terminate a child process on Windows</h1>Camille,<div><br></div><div>My experience using sys:open-pipe on Windows is that is a very blunt force approach to interacting with another process. The only way to interact with the process is through the bidirectional stream returned by open-pipe. This means you have to understand the idiosyncrasies of the process you are interacting with. In my specific case, I can send a command to the process, but it wont execute until I&#39;ve read all of the output generated for the bidirectional stream. When I send the process it&#39;s &quot;exit&quot; command, again, the process does not actually close until all of the output has been read. So, using this process with open-pipe required me to learn more about the input/output buffering behavior of the process than I really ever cared to know. This behavior is process specific, because when I initially experimented with open-pipe, I used gnuplot as the test process and it did not require any of the output to be read to execute new commands or close.</div>
<div><br></div><div>If you really need as fine control as your post suggests, you probably need to get familiar with the FLI. I would take this approach with the process of my example, except that it is a legacy Fortran process and I&#39;m not confident that I would be able to use the FLI to interface with Fortran code. With WIN32 libraries I think you&#39;ll have much better luck.</div>
