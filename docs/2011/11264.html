                <pre>
Are there any charting libraries for LW or OpenGL that can be used with LW?

I'm looking for stock charts, including candlesticks.

	Thanks, Joel

Greetings to the List...

I mentioned a bit ago that I was starting to work toward embedding a 
webcam into a LispWorks application.

I quickly discovered that there really is no easily deciphered 
documentation in the WIN32 world on how to do that.

After some trial-and-error wandering through the various branch 
paths, I have the webcam now embedded and running stably, reliably, 
and fluidly with only WIN32 calls in our delivered real-time livescan 
fingerprinting system.

To embed a webcam into a Lisp/CAPI application is really quite simple 
once you figure it out and get things straight, though there are some 
interesting (a.k.a irritating :) pitfalls here and there.

Please contact me if anyone ever needs that sort of thing - a 
real-time streaming video webcam in Lisp Space - and I will walk you 
through it.


Also, a quick question:    Will gp:write-external-image &amp;| Friends 
create an external .JPF file?   Or, will CAPI really only create a 
..BMP file under WIN32??

If CAPI will not happily create a .JPG, is there a graceful way to do 
that from inside Lisp???


I appreciate any comments.

&gtHi Jack,
&gt
&gtYou can create and save images in several formats, see for example
&gthere: http://weitz.de/mandelbrot/#image



Guten Abend Edi -

Did you have to build your own JPG output function from scratch - or, 
were you able to use something already existing??

I ran the Mandelbrot.exe and it is very nice indeed!

I didn't have to do anything.  The user selects a file name to write
to (using CAPI:PROMPT-FOR-FILE which in my case offers "PNG", "JPG",
"TIFF" and "BMP" as filters) and then I just do

          (externalize-and-write-image pane image file-name
                                       :if-exists :supersede
                                       ;; only needed for JPEG,
otherwise ignored
                                       :quality 100)

where FILE-NAME is what was returned by PROMPT-FOR-FILE and PANE is
the output pane.  LispWorks does the rest automatically, including
figuring out what to do based on the file's suffix.

Here it is, BTW:
http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw61/CAPRM/html/capiref-540.htm

You need LW 6.1 or higher, though.
