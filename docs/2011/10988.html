                <pre>
Hello,

Is there a version of with-deadline or with-timeout (as in SBCL,
http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.steel-bank.devel/8965) for
Lispworks?  I've looked in the manual for awhile but couldn't find it.

Thank you,
David

There are implementations in one or the other portability layer. The more important question is though, why you want to use such a thing? This construct is simply not a good idea**. LispWorks has I/O timeouts with its stream API and it has alot of different tools to control concurrent processes in a sane and coordinated way.

ciao,
Jochen

To the OP: I highly recommend looking into this. I used to use
with-timeout with Allegro, and IMHO you gain a lot by redesigning your
code to use I/O timeouts if that's what you use with-timeout for.

But I guess there may be cases where with-timout is really useable,
e.g. if you've got some big black box of code that may or may not run
too long and you wish to control it.

Hi Jochen and Espen,

Thanks for the quick replies.

I need to implement semaphores in user space, because I need a feature
that Gary Byers and I call "semphore notification objects."
Implementing semaphores correctly often brings along with it race
conditions, and the with-deadline construct is useful in implementing
timeouts correctly while avoiding one of these race conditions.

There are probably other ways of doing it -- Martin mentioned one to
me recently, and I'll probably try that if what I'm looking for
doesn't exist.  Issuing an "(apropos 'timeout) yielded many results,
but they all looked specific to a particular function call like
(process-wait/wait-for-stack/etc.-wiith-timeout ...).  I'm wondering
if there's a more general primitive.

Thanks,
David

Hi Jochen,

Interesting idea.  You'll be relieved to know that we do everything
with interrupts blocked in the unwind portion of the unwind-protects.

Thanks!
David

Sorry for the mostly-needless followup, but I wanted to clarify that
the "everything" refers to "everything related to multi-threading".

One more note, in case anyone looks at this later (I'm assuming these
email lists are searchable).  The call to mp:unschedule-timer should
be part of an unwind-protect with interrupts disabled during the
cleanup form.

Thanks again~
