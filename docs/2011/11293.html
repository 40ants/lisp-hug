I work with Arabic myself and I have never managed to get the characters to display in the listener or editor either. I think it's really a font issue though.

You can make a couple of quick functions to put up a CAPI based window with the strings you need to see as a workaround. For Arabic I use an ascii based transliteration but I guess that's not really workable for Chinese.
