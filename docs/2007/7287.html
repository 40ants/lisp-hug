Hi all,

in your experience, what database is simplest to install and support to
provide some basic backend storage for LW apps deployed on Windows?  I'm
not doing anything with heavy loads, I'm more concerned with simplicity
and installation from the standpoint of the end user.

Are you talking about SQL databases that are supported by some Lisp
library?  In that case I'd use SQLite with CLSQL.  Requires just two
DLLs (one for SQLite and one for CLSQL) that you can deliver with your
app.

Of course, you don't have to use SQL (not clear from your very broad
question), you could for example just store your data in flat files
using ANSI-compatible CL.  Or use something like BKNR's store.  There
are lots of options where no installation on the side of the end user
is required.

Provided (any version of) MS Office is also installed, I would recommend
Access (MS Jet) via ODBC. The MS Jet dll is preinstalled on every Windows
box but you would need a special effort to setup the Access ODBC driver when
MS Office were not there.

 &gt OT1H, the native library is not thread-safe and should be used cautiously.

according to SQLite FAQs, it is threadsafe since version 3.3.1:
