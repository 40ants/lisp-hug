                <h1>cl-yacc vs parsegen:defparser</h1>
                <pre>
Is there any reason to prefer one over the other?

	Thanks, Joel

Joel,

&gtFrom your series of questions, it's hard to tell what you are trying to 
accomplish (e.g. maybe a pretty-printer, or maybe a full-blown compiler). 

You mentioned C/C++/C#.  These languages (C/C++ for sure, C# I don't know) are 
ridiculously "hard" to parse because you can't simply do it using syntax 
alone.  You will end up needing to track typedefs, you will end up needing to 
deal with macros.  For example, the statements:

MACRO();

and

MACRO;

and

MACRO

are "legal", but are not part of the 'formal' syntax of C/C++ (they are 
stripped out by the macro processor before the code reaches the parser).

Furthermore, typedefs make the syntax of C/C++ ambiguous and you will need to 
build symbol tables into the scanner to disambiguate.

Using a bottom-up parser (e.g. yacc's) will force you to go all the way, even 
if you want something "simpler".

Whatever you do, you are going to find that you need a "state machine" of some 
kind for parsing this class of languages.

If you are trying to accomplish something simpler (like a pretty printer), you 
might want to also look at backtracking parsers - e.g. TXL (not lisp) and the 
fairly new parsing technology called packrat parsing (PEG).  I think (but 
don't know) that Antlr may also have abilities of this kind (or different 
abilities that attack the same problem).  

In fact, in the next compiler I build (esp. if it were for a c-like language), 
I would look carefully at PEG parsing.  But, then, I enjoy building compiler 
tools :-).  Ymmv.
