                <h1>Internationalization and shortcuts</h1>
                <pre>
Hi,

I¹m looking for info about shortcuts and accelerators compatibility between
languages and types of keyboards.

I work on a AZERTY keyboard because I speak French. On this type of kb the
normal undo accelerator is Command-Z (or Control-Z on Windows) because Z is
the position of the U on a QUERTY keyboard...

Now, if I write an accelerator for an Undo item, Command-U will be wrong for
a French User, and naturally Command-Z will be wrong for an English or
American User.

What's the solution to this kind of situation ?

For Shortcuts, the problem is a little bit different : I would like to use
the Option+character or Shift-Option+character. But the characters generated
by these shortcuts are naturally not the same on a French or an English
system. If I write a shortcut on the character "è" for instance, I'm afraid
you can never use it on an English system...

Is it a solution to write a shortcut witch is really the combination of :
a modifiers combination + a simple character
independently of witch character is locally generated by this shortcut on a
system or another one ?

Thanks for any links or comments

Denis

Hello Denis,

Russian localized software always binds the undo command with Control-Z as
if on QUERTY. In my experience, the accelerator invoke this command even
when the Windows locale and keyboard layout is Russian. The common practice
of choosing accelerators is transliterating some letter (usually the first)
to English.

(Sometimes accelerators defined in a CAPI interface stop working, and the
user has to switch to another window and back to reanimate them but this is
a distinct question :-))

But take into account that Russian is based on Cyrillic, and after switching
the keyboard layout, you get absolutely different letters for all the
alphabetic buttons of the keyboard, not just the same Latin letters (with
few variants) laid out differently.

I am afraid not. For many keys, I do customize binding like
     (bind-key "Grid Undo" #\Control-\Ya)
     (bind-key "Grid Undo" #\Control-\Capital-Ye).
So I would suggest delivering localized versions of your application.

But, it depends what you mean by "localized version". On Mac I use the

duplication of the codes), does it exists something similar for shortcuts?

Thanks for your answer Dmitriy

So do I. You could need more than just string, but also, for example,
mnemonic positions. I have not managed to avoid featuring my code with
#-Russian and #+Russian and placing fasl-files into different subdirectories
of bin/.

If I well understand, I have to do this in my key-event-callback :

-replace my shortcuts by calls to Localized Strings
-in the external .string files, write the equivalent characters for (for
instance) SHIFT-OPTION-E in French, in English, etc. (and first find it...)
-finally deal with these strings in the test

Is that correct ?

Thanks for your help

I do not know what your Localized Strings facility is exactly, so I can only
guess that this should work.

The logic is simple: the copy/paste/cut and command command are close  
together in functionality, and their keys are close together for  
convenience (on a QWERTY): ZXCV. Don't try to find any mnemonic,  
except for Copy (C), and maybe Cut (X = cross out, delete). The V and  
Z keys are nearby, and easy to reach in combination with the Control  
key.

Cheers,
Peter.
