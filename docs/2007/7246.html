                <h1>Character writing question</h1>
                <pre>
I have a trivial form to dump some html data read via drakma, currently in sbcl:

(setf *drakma-default-external-format* :utf8)

    (with-open-file
    	(s (pathname (concatenate 'string "/tmp/tm-" name ".html"))
		   :direction :output :if-exists :supersede)
	            (write-sequence page s))

And I get this error in WRITE-SEQUENCE:

Error: #\' is not of type BASE-CHAR

where the ' is (I believe) the Windows single quote character.

OTOH, if I add :element-type '(unsigned-byte 8) to the OPEN args I get this:

"..." contains non-integer element #\Newline.

also in WRITE-SEQUENCE.

I'm sure this is a simple fix.  Thanks in advance for your help and patience.

No, I don't think so.

  CL-USER 1 &gt (typep #\' 'base-char)

Try to open the file with :ELEMENT-TYPE 'LW:SIMPLE-CHAR.

Probably a curly quote.  That's not Win32-specific, you'll find it in
almost any book.

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_quotes

It's not an ASCII character, though.

&gt Unfortunately I got the same error

How about a backtrace?

&gt Is it useful to mention that the stream object is
&gt LATIN-1-FILE-STREAM?

Ugh, so maybe your character is not in Latin-1?  Have you tried other
external formats like UTF-8?

Works for me (LWW 5.0.2):

  CL-USER 6 &gt *target*
  "‘Curly quotes inside’"

  CL-USER 7 &gt (ppcre:regex-replace-all *regex* *target* "'")

  CL-USER 9 &gt (defun foo (target) (ppcre:regex-replace-all #.*regex* target "'"))
  FOO

  CL-USER 10 &gt (compile *)
  FOO
  NIL
  NIL

  CL-USER 11 &gt (foo *target*)

  T

  CL-USER 12 &gt (map 'list #'char-code *)

What exactly doesn't work for you?

I'm beginning to seriously doubt that...

&gt Hmmm.  I'm not sure why a simple regex on an html page with a curly
&gt quote works under sbcl but not under LW.  So I really don't know
&gt where to look next.  Perhaps I need to force latin-1 encoding when
&gt fetching the page?  I'm new to most of these encoding issues as it
