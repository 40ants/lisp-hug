                <h1>LWM - no services menu</h1>
                <pre>
I'm cc'ing support here as well, but have any other LWM users noticed  
that the Services menu is empty on both the IDE and any applications  
created with CAPI? The docs say (well, actually the sample code says,  
since the docs refer the reader to /Applications/LispWorks 5.0/ 
Library/lib/5-0-0-0/examples/capi/applications/cocoa- 
application.lisp) that:

  ;; This is a special named component where the CAPI will
;; attach the standard Services menu.
:name :application-services

However, at least on 5.0.1 (Intel), the services menu is empty, both  
in the IDE, and the examples provided. Possibly this has something to  
do with the fact that LispWorks' main menu is not merely a plain  
vanilla NSMenu as in your typical cocoa app, but rather an instance  
of LWCAPIMenuRepresentation, a custom subclass of NSMenu[1]. In  
addition calling the equivalent of [[NSApplication sharedApplication]  
servicesMenu] returns nil, so there is nothing provided by LispWorks  
for a services menu.

So, first, do others see this?

Second, is there any fix availably or likely? I can't help thinking  
that this is related to Bill Atkins' problem with drag and drop. The  
services menu is populated when the user clicks on it by determining  
if there are any objects in the responder chain within the  
application that could utilize any of the available services.  
Similarly, drags are supposed to be forwarded up the responder chain,  
but as Bill Atkins' problem showed, drags are not forwarded if they  
are to CAPI panes, even capi:cocoa-view-panes. It would seem that  
CAPI may not be forwarding events up the responder chain in the way  
that the AppKit expects.

regards,

Ralph

I can confirm this with LW 5.0.1 and Mac OS X 10.4.8 on both PPC  
(PowerBook) and Intel (Mac Pro).

As an occasional Services menu user I do miss it.
