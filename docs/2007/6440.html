                <h1>Application</h1>
                <pre>
Hello,

I deliver an LW5 application for Windows compressed into about 450 MB  
on CD or for download via FTP.
On two separate occasions, clients have reported the following error  
after installing the application.

"The application has failed to start because the application  
configuration is incorrect.
Reinstalling the application may fix this problem."

Both clients were running Windows XP Professional.
Reinstalling did not work for either client.
Both an Astrum installer and a self-extracting Stuffit archive gave  
the same result for one client.

Other clients have not reported a problem and I am unable to produce  
the problem by installing
the same compressed application file as the client.

The file structure (screen capture) looks correct.

Has anyone encountered a similar problem?
Any ideas?

Thanks,
Sheldon

Have you checked whether the clients have the Microsoft runtime
library installed?

I didn't see a screen capture.

Cheers,

&gt What is the Microsoft runtime library and how does one install it?

It's briefly mentioned in 3.2.2 of the LWW Release Notes.  If you
search Gmane's archive of this mailing list, you'll find some lengthy
discussions of this topic in the second half of 2006.

Here

  http://weitz.de/starter-pack/#install
  http://weitz.de/regex-coach/#install

are sample installation instructions for Windows applications
delivered with LispWorks 5.0.

HTH,
Edi.

It is very unlikely that you don't have it and can run LWW 5.0 then.
Also note that the release notes say that LispWorks' installer will
install this library automatically if needed.  (Well, probably unless
you have Vista or something like that in which case the runtime
library is likely part of the OS already.)

This is with LW 4.4.6.
I thought the two expressions below should produce the same result (1), but
they don't:

&gt (setf x "1:")
&gt (read-from-string x (subseq x 0 1))  -&gt Error: No package named "1"

&gt (setf y (subseq x 0 1))
&gt (read-from-string y)  -&gt 1

Thanks for any insight.

Mitch

I think this is a mistype:

&gt&gt (read-from-string x (subseq x 0 1))

There should be no "x" if I read your intentions correctly (you are  
passing the result of (subseq x 0 1) as a value to eof-error-p  
argument of read-from-string).

y is the string "1"; the subscripts on subseq aren't inclusive.

CL-USER&gt (setf x "1:")
"1:"
CL-USER&gt (read-from-string x)
; The expected error...
CL-USER&gt (setf y (subseq x 0 1))
"1" ; this is y
CL-USER&gt (read-from-string y)
1
1
