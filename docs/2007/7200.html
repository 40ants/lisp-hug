                <h1>Find-source</h1>
                <pre>
Hello,

On Mac 10.4 :

When using the "find source" facility : some time - but not all the time, I
don¹t understand why ­ if a buffer witch contains the source already exists,
a duplicated buffer is opened rather then using the existing one (witch
seems to be the normal behavior).

This is annoying because it's necessary to close manually the oldest buffer
when a new one is opened. Otherwise it's possible to make some changes on
two different buffers...

Is it a tip to make that "find source" doesn't open a new buffer if one
already exists ? Or is it a kind of bug ?


Thanks

Denis

I'm not sure if this explains it but when this happens to me, it's
usually because
I've previously read in the file manually and I've been a bit lazy about
the case, 
letting the file system do the right thing.  So, if I open the file
"opengl/foo.lisp",
the filesystem is happy to comply even if the filename is actually
"OpenGL/foo.lisp".
Presumably the pathname matching used by Find Source is stricter.

Yes, your right, when there is some capital letters in the title of the
file, the system open a new buffer, the first named "OpenGL/foo.lisp" and
the second "opengl/foo.lisp&lt;2&gt". I remember that I changed all the title of
my files for this reason.

But now I use systematically lowercase names. So, even if he problem as
something to do with the name, what I observe is not simply a case question
: the reaction of the system seems to change during the session, depending
of the context, in a manner I really don't understand. When the problems
occurs, the system start to open new buffers on "find source" calls, and it
do it for *each* file. If the buffer is edited and not saved, the system
asks to know witch version open. But in any case it opens it in a new buffer
with the suffix "&lt;2&gt".

Generally this appends after a while when I have a lot of buffers opened.
It's also why it's so annoying...

thanks

Denis

No I'm wrong, excuse-me.

When the problem occurs, effectively I can see a difference in the 2
pathnames in the "Buffers" tab of the editor. It's a case difference (your
right), but the difference is in the directory name, not in the filename...
The difference is always in the name of the root folder of my project, or
some subdirectories.

So it seems that I can resolve the situation if I change all the folder
names in my codes and recompile my project. Do you thing it's right ?


Thanks 

Denis
