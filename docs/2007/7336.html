<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="3">Expert Systems: Principles and Programming, Third Edition: Principles and Programming</font></div>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Expert-Systems-Principles-Programming-Third/dp/0534950531" target="_blank">http://www.amazon.com/Expert-Systems-Principles-Programming-Third/dp/0534950531</a></p>
<div>The authors use CLIPS as their implementation language, but CLIPS and KW seem to belong to the OPS5 family, so you shouldn&#39;t have any trouble. Truthfully, that (and the KW docs) should be enough to get you started, We use KW extensively for our system so I can help some (time permitting) if you get flummoxed.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>NB: CLIPS is strictly a forward-chaining system (or at least it used to be), whereas KW has both forward and backward chaining engines. We have found this combination in KW to be very powerful, but the KW docs are sometimes a bit subtle. For example, buried somewhere in the doc is a sentence that tells us forward-chaining rule RHSs are implemented using the backward-chainer. I missed the implications of that when I first started with KW, and had to discover the elegance of that approach through trial-and-error (and some support questions to Lispworks).

<div>Hope this helps.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This is the proper way to do it in KW. TEST forms are &quot;computationally cheap&quot;, according to the docs. I&#39;ve found, while CLIPS syntax seems more powerful at first, in the long run KW is just as flexible and more readable.

<div>I&#39;d say this is ok. The Lispworks guys might have more to add on this one.</div>
