Hi all here on the list!

First one for me here - new to LW but not new to Lisp ;-) As I am  
coming from a different implementation I am seeing challenges I  
wasn't having before ...

That is (using LW PE on Mac OS X Intel 10.4.10):

(defun main ()
    (run-window 'gnc-app-test01 nil))

(defun test01-main ()
   #+lispworks
     (mp:process-send mp:*main-process* '(main))
   #-lispworks
     (main)
)

Now I open the stepper and because I need to do mp:process-send I am  
loosing the process stepping. In other words I can't step into the  
main function when stepping from test01-main. Wanted to be clever  
then an put a breakpoint into main at (run-window ...) - but, hey, I  
never get LW to stop there ... The only chance is to put  (break) in  
at some place. Which I did in a function 'tk-togl-init which gets  
called from within 'run-window:

So far so good. Now I get a Listener window popping up giving me a  
few choices but no way to step from there ...

I get a crash of LW somewhere after that point and I need to step ...  
Any ideas/hints/pointers on how to achieve this is really  
appreciated ...

Thanks!!!

Frank

I think what you are running into is that you can't step in a user  
interface process on the Mac. All interfaces use a single process, so  
stepping would lock up the entire interface. This is a major  
limitation of the Mac version that I hope gets solved some day.

Another way out could be starting the stepper programmatically... Is  
there any way to do that ?

Thx!
