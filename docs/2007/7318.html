The major part of your problem is that you list only Zappa albums instead of 
Johnny Winter albums (a life-long battle I've had with my 4-year younger 
brother).

Actually, your interface is quite nice (and I'm going to keep the code to 
steal from it), but not like anything I've seen in "standard" Windows apps.

The .../examples/double-list-panel.lisp code produces something that I have 
seen in "sorting" situtations on Windows, esp. the "multiple" and "extended" 
selection examples.

The items-to-be-sorted appear in the left-hand panel.  You select one, then 
click the right-arrow.  The item is removed from the left-hand panel and then 
appears as the last item on the right-hand panel.  If you want to change the 
order, you select a right-hand-panel item and click the left-pointing arrow, 
to put the item back into the "available" list.

You interface is "better", IMO.  But the double-list-panel is more "idiomatic" 
on Windows, as far as I know.

Yep.  It surprised me, too, but it looks like it happens by design. 

Did you try specifying an :external-max-width for the pane?  (In the 
define-interface).

Yes, now that you say it - I've seen that as well.  But of course you
have to click a lot.

I've also thought about up- and down-arrows (I've seen that as well),
but again this is asking the user to click a lot.

&gt Did you try specifying an :external-max-width for the pane?

Yes, I tried that, and that works.  I was just surprised to see the
effect I described.

Hello Edi,

| 1. Is there (on Windows) a more idiomatic, readily available,
|    easy-to-use-from-CAPI way to do the same thing that I missed
|    somehow?

AFAIK, the idiomatic way on Windows is to equip the dialog with a couple of
buttons "Move Up" and "Move Down". But your solution looks very attractive
and could be a nice augmentation!

| 2. If I comment out the :HORIZONTAL-SCROLL line and recompile and if I
|    then drag one of the rectangles far enough to the right, the
|    pinboard layout and thus the whole interface gets bigger and bigger
|    and never shrinks back into place again.  Is this expected
|    behaviour?  (It surprised me.)

As Paul has suggested,  :visible-min-width nil and :visible-max-width nil
partially solve the problem - you can at least resize the interface manually
to the previous size.

| Is there a way to force an interface to be always quadratic even if

| like Photoshop.)

I would suggest attaching the following resize-callback to your pane:

(defvar %in-resize-callback% nil)
(defun resize-callback (pinboard x y width height)
  (unless %in-resize-callback%
    (let ((interface (capi:top-level-interface pinboard)))
      (multiple-value-setq (x y width height)
          (capi:top-level-interface-geometry interface))
      (let ((%in-resize-callback% t)
            (side (max width height)))
        (capi:set-top-level-interface-geometry interface
                                               :x x :y y :width side :height
side)))))

Alternatively, you could specify a similar geometry-change-callback for your
top-level interface provided you invoked it by means of capi:display instead
of capi:display-dialog.

                 <pre>Hi Edi &amp; list,

Here is what I've got for something similar.
This version is based on move up &amp; down buttons associated with a list-panel.
There are also move first &amp; last buttons to accelerate this kind of moves.

It is quite powerful for sorting items quickly with not that much mouse clicks as the list-panel is of type extended-selection.
You can move items even when the selection is not contigous.

I'm currently using it for sorting lists of a few dozen elements (not as nice as your solution for small lists I guess).

Finally, it needs iterate to run (and it's really bad looking as I have extracted it from some of my existing code).
I'm running it with :

CL-USER 1 &gt (require :iterate)
CL-USER 2 &gt (test)

Hope this helps,
Cheers,
Sebastien.

Is there an input-model gesture which I can use to set up a callback
for the mouse wheel (so that I can use it to call a function which
will zoom)?

Hi Mitch,

AFAIK there is no input model gesture. I succeeded in providing mousewheel support within a pinboard layout by using the pinboards
:scroll-callback. This callback is triggered on mousewheel movements.
