Hi, LispWorks

Recently, when I use a LALR parser package called Zebu, I found this:

ZEBU 14 &gt (compile-slr-grammar "ex1.zb")

Reading grammar from ex1.zb

Error: Using package ZEBU results in a name conflict for this symbol:
LISPWORKS:PRINT-ACTIONS.
  1 (continue) Unintern the conflicting symbol from its home package.
  2 Shadow the conflicting symbols.
  3 Shadowing-import the conflicting symbol already visible in
COMMON-LISP-USER.
  4 Shadowing-import the conflicting symbol from ZEBU.
  5 Skip using ZEBU by COMMON-LISP-USER.
  6 (abort) Return to level 0.
  7 Return to top loop level 0.

Type :b for backtrace, :c &lt;option number&gt to proceed,  or :? for other
options

ZEBU 15 : 1 &gt :c 2

I found the symbol LISPWORKS:PRINT-ACTIONS is external in COMMON-LISP.
If someone define the same symbol, a name conflict will happen. Is this
a trivial bug? Since I think the COMMON-LISP package should have any
external symbol which doesn't appear in Common Lisp Standard.

Thanks.

I haven't attempted to duplicate this myself but it appears that ZEBU is
attempting to intern symbols in the COMMON-LISP-USER package (rather
than the COMMON-LISP package).

While not a bug, it is not recommended practise (I'd go as far as to
call it poor form) and I'd suggest either contacting the author and
requesting him to intern symbols into a different package (the current 
binding of *package* for example) or changing the offending code
yourself.


&gt I found the symbol LISPWORKS:PRINT-ACTIONS is external in COMMON-LISP.

It doesn't appear to be (external in CL or CL-USER), it is an inherited
symbol.

&gt If someone define the same symbol, a name conflict will happen. Is this
&gt a trivial bug? Since I think the COMMON-LISP package should have any
&gt external symbol which doesn't appear in Common Lisp Standard.

Yes, there is a restriction on what external symbols the COMMON-LISP 
package may have, but, there are no restrictions on internal-symbols,
nor the packages it may have on it's package-use-list which means that
conflicts like this can still occur in conforming programs running on 
conforming implementations.


Cheers,
 Sean.

&gt &gt
&gt &gt   
&gt Thanks for the explanation.
&gt 
&gt I recheck the source code, the author just define a function named
&gt print-actions in ZEBU package and export it.(but no code use this
&gt function...)
&gt 
&gt And I cannot find that "ZEBU is attempting to intern symbols in the
&gt COMMON-LISP-USER package", there's no such code, I think. (You can find
&gt source on http://constantly.at/lisp/zebu-3.5.5-asdf.tgz)


I've taken a quick peek and the source of the problem isn't in the zebu source
code itself but in the grammar file test/ex1.zb.

the first form in the file specifies what package is going to be used 
(or whatever zebu does with it) and in this case it is CL-USER. 
I changed this package to a fresh package I created (which only uses :CL and :ZEBU)
and the grammar compilation succeeded.

Cheers, 
 Sean.
