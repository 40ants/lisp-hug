                <h1>CL-GD on OS X</h1>
                <pre>
Hi,

I just joined the list, so sorry if this has been covered.  Has  
anyone installed CL-GD on on OS X.  I'm using Lispworks 5.  I  
compiled CL-GD-GLUE fine, and it seems to load, but I get a series of  
errors when I run the test.

I'm sure it's a stupid configuration problem, but maybe someone else  
has worked through it before?

Thanks,
Chhi'mèd

Have you called fli:register-module to load libgd before trying to  
call function in that library?

It's probably more appropriate to continue this discussion on the
CL-GD mailing list.  I've put the list on Cc, but you'll have to
subscribe to post something there.

&gt Has anyone installed CL-GD on on OS X.  I'm using Lispworks 5.  I
&gt compiled CL-GD-GLUE fine, and it seems to load, but I get a series

I don't have a Mac, so I can't confirm that CL-GD runs on OS X, but I
think that there's nothing specific in the code that prevents it from
running there.

&gt "_gdImageCreate".

The underline shouldn't be there.  The C function is called
"gdImageCreate" (unless this is some name mangling convention on OS X
that I'm not aware of).

Where did you get the GD library from and where is it located?
