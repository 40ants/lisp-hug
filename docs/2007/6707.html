                <h1>FLI pointers</h1>
                <pre>
Hi

I am confused about whether FLI pointers types (the pointer type itself, 
not that what the pointer points to) are immediate or aggregate types. 
The Lispworks documentation specifies it as both:
immediate: 
http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw50/FLI/html/fli-17.htm#pgfId-888612
aggregate:
http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw50/FLI/html/fli-23.htm#pgfId-886654
(first sentence)

Also, section 3.4 of the FLI User Guide says:
"When a pointer is created, using make-pointer, or due to the allocation 
of a foreign object, memory is put aside to store the details of the 
pointer. However, if a pointer is only needed within the scope of a 
particular section of code, there is an FLI macro, with-coerced-pointer, 
which can be used to create a temporary pointer which is automatically 
deallocated at the end of the code." Does this mean that the following 
are more or less equivalent?

(fli:with-coerced-pointer (temp) array-obj
   ...)

(let ((temp (fli:copy-pointer array-obj)))
   ...)

If not, please answer the following:

(setf array-obj
       (fli:allocate-foreign-object :type :int
                   :nelems 10
                   :initial-contents '(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)))

(fli:with-coerced-pointer (temp) array-obj
   (dotimes (x 10)
     (print (fli:dereference temp))
     (fli:incf-pointer temp)))

Can I now still use array-obj after these expressions have been 
evaluated or has it's memory been freed? with-coerced-pointer does not 
create a copy of what is being pointed to (I have tested this), does it?

Or does the documentation for with-coerced-pointer apply to the pointer 
and not what the pointer points to? E.g.:

(setq point1 (fli:allocate-foreign-object :type :char))
(setq point2 (fli:copy-pointer point1))
(fli:free-foreign-object point1)

Does point2 now still consume memory that have to be freed (as 
with-coerced-pointer would have automatically freed it)? If so, how do I 
free it as free-foreign-object frees what is being pointed to, not the 
pointer, which I suspect is an immediate type and automatically freed by 
GC, right?

Thanks.
Nico

No one else has answered thus far, so I will give you my guess - but it is 
only a guess.

Maybe you can figure out how to test my guess...

&gt (setq point1 (fli:allocate-foreign-object :type :char))
&gt (setq point2 (fli:copy-pointer point1))
&gt (fli:free-foreign-object point1)

I tried something like this, but I added another pointer - point3 which is 
a '(:pointer :char) - a pointer to a pointer to a char.

I used (setf (fli:dereference point3) point1).

I used the inspector to look at point3.

Then I deallocated point3 and looked at it with the inspector.  Point3 still 
existed, but its fields were cleared.

So, I conclude that pointers are immediate types.  The mis-wording in the docs 
is trying to say that if a pointer points to an aggregate type, then the 
thing pointed to by the pointer is indeed an aggregate type.

This is all exacerbated by C's squishy semantics - esp. arrays vs. structs 
passed as parameters - and Lispworks' desire to make the FLI interface 
easy-to-use.

&gt (fli:with-coerced-pointer (temp) array-obj
&gt    ...)
&gt
&gt (let ((temp (fli:copy-pointer array-obj)))
&gt    ...)

With-coerced-pointer is a C "cast".  FLI pointers are objects that carry the 
target type around inside them.  To get C's "cast" behaviour, you have to 
temporarily change the pointer's idea of what it's target type is.  C does 
this at compile time.  FLI creates actual run-time objects, so you need to 
tinker with their idea of type - the best choice is to clone the pointer and 
futz with the cloned pointer's type field.

&gt                    :initial-contents '(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)))
&gt
&gt (fli:with-coerced-pointer (temp) array-obj
&gt    (dotimes (x 10)
&gt      (print (fli:dereference temp))
&gt      (fli:incf-pointer temp)))

Correct.  Array-obj is an object (struct / whatever).  
FLI:allocate-foreign-object creates two objects - the foreign object and the 
pointer object.

FLI:with-coerced-pointer creates a copy of the pointer object (and changes its 
type field).  

At this point, there are two pointer objects (temp and array-obj) and one 
array object (unnamed).

When the temp object disappears, the array-obj pointer object remains and so 
does the actual 10-element unnamed array object.

Simply try out the code you've written.  Use the inspector.

&gt
&gt Or does the documentation for with-coerced-pointer apply to the pointer
&gt and not what the pointer points to? E.g.:
&gt
&gt (setq point1 (fli:allocate-foreign-object :type :char))
&gt (setq point2 (fli:copy-pointer point1))
&gt (fli:free-foreign-object point1)
&gt
&gt Does point2 now still consume memory that have to be freed (as
&gt with-coerced-pointer would have automatically freed it)? If so, how do I
&gt free it as free-foreign-object frees what is being pointed to, not the
&gt pointer, which I suspect is an immediate type and automatically freed by
&gt GC, right?

Yes, that's my guess, too.  The "memory" consumed by a pointer object is 
memory within GC-able space.  The "memory" consumed by aggregate objects is 
not in GC space.  Deep voodoo magic within FLI tracks whether the objects are 
in GC space or non-GC space.  If you deallocate a GC space object - i.e. an 
immediate object - FLI simply clears the pointer's fields, then lets the GC 
clean up some time in the future.

If my guess turns out to be wrong - let me know!
