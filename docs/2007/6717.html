                <pre>
I'm trying to port Arnesi to LW 5.0.

Few obstacles here and there - I've gotten it down to where there's
one in my way I can't solve:

I'm guessing that Arnesi was originally meant to be compatible with a
pre-5.0 Lispworks.

I cannot find or figure out a replacement for
 harlequin-common-lisp:augment-environment

I ask here, and not on the dev list for the project, as while this is
an external library, the issue involves up-to-date lispworks details.



Context:



(defmethod augment-with-variable ((env lexical::environment) var)
  (harlequin-common-lisp:augment-environment
   env :variable (list var)))


(defmethod augment-with-function ((env lexical::environment) fun)
  (harlequin-common-lisp:augment-environment
   env :function (list fun)))


(defmethod augment-with-macro ((env lexical::environment) mac def)
  (harlequin-common-lisp:augment-environment
   env :macro (list (list mac def))))


(defmethod augment-with-symbol-macro ((env lexical::environment) symmac def)
  (harlequin-common-lisp:augment-environment
   env :symbol-macro (list (list symmac def))))




Thanks,
Matt

Hi

Matthew asked this in 2007.   Any news on this front?
Without the CLtL2 environment functions there is little hope of  
writing portable walkers.

Cheers

Yeah, a concrete example is type information. Imagine you have a
(compiler) macro that could heavily optimize the case where some
argument is of a certain type or its numeric value within a certain
range. Environment access could give you the type information of your
own declarations, but also any declarations in third-party code. So a
uniform interface is good.

But if you are the only producer and consumer of the declaration
information, the method Pascal showed is fine. In CLPython I need to
keep track of lexical Python-specific state during compilation. I use
Pascal's method there in all Lisp implementation except for Allegro
CL, as the latter lets you define your own declaration type using
sys:define-declaration, so you can use regular (declare ..) to stuff
information in the environment, and get that out again using
sys:declaration-information.

As I've said before, it would be great if Lispworks provided an
interface similar to Allegro's.
