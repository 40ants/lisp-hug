                <h1>editor - not a base char</h1>
                <pre>
If I copy/paste a lump of text from Microsoft Word into an lispworks (LWW 5.01 
on w2k) editor pane, this appears to work.  If I then try to save the buffer, 
I get an error "#\.  is not of type BASE-CHAR".  (With some debugging, I 
think that the #\. is meant to say #\U+2019).

Obviously Word is using some non-ascii (unicode?) character.  I think that I 
simply want the file to be saved (without conversion?).  Is there a simple 
fix for this?

Although my final app needs to do this with a capi editor pane in a gui, I get 
the same behaviour when I simply paste the Word doc into the lispworks 
editor.

thanks

I don't know if there is a simple fix. I think I handled it by giving  
an error message and suggesting that the selected file encoding had  
to be changed.

Depending on your application, maybe just make UTF-8 or UFT-16 the  
default external format.
