                <h1>single instance application delivery?</h1>
                <pre>
When revisiting my delivery on Windows I noticed that the application 
is a multiple instance application (the Windows default).  Can this 
be changed?  I'm looking through the Delivery keywords and I haven't 
found an applicable one yet.

If it matters, my application is multithreaded and headless, using 
neither the console nor CAPI.  But, if launched repeatedly I get 
repeated instances in the process queue, which I'd prefer to avoid.

If I google for "windows single instance application", I find lots of
pages explaining different ways how one can achieve this.  One of them
says:

  "Limiting an application to a single instance is very problematic.
   There are dozens of solutions available; most of them work most of
   the time."

So, I guess there's no "official way" and no silver bullet - you have
to roll your own facility.  And that's probably the reason LW doesn't
provide this out of the box.  Are you aware of other Windows IDEs
where this is controlled with a simple switch?

Cheers,
Edi.

There may be a better way, but after my application starts
I use DDE to check whether another instance exists.

My application uses CAPI and has the idea of files/documents
that belong to the application, so some of the following
is probably not relevant to you.  But I've included those
details because they may be interesting to someone else.

On startup, my application determines whether there is an
already-existing instance by sending a DDE message.  If
there is no other instance, it starts a DDE server.  If
there is another instance, the new instance sends the old
instance a message to get it to open a document or activate
the main application window and then the new instance quits.

The DDE server also allows files/documents to be opened from
Windows Explorer if you set up a Windows file type
appropriately.

I wrote the code below a very long time ago and am not proud
of (sheez -- it has an EVAL), but it works.  (Well, I've
removed some fluff from the code before posting it so maybe
I've removed something important, but I don't think so.)

Here's a note I made at the time I wrote the code:

- Whenever you call any DDE function, the current thread
  is registered with the DDE library and is expected to
  process Windows messages.  So when on startup you check
  whether this is a duplicate application instance, the DDE
  message must be sent in the same process as will later run
  the DDE server.  Otherwise you get all sorts of nasty hanging.

I suppose that's true, but I feel like it was written by someone
else (it was me a long time ago) and, also, perhaps things
have changed, so I won't make any promises.

If you're not using CAPI, I guess you need to run this code
in a separate process and after everything is set up arrange
for the processing of Windows messages.  To process Windows
messages you can do
   (CAPI::LOOP-PROCESS-EVENTS NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL)

CAPI::LOOP-PROCESS-EVENTS is undocumented and maybe unsupported;
I think LW support told me about it.

Here's the code:

I've run this code with no problems for many years now on
Windows 98, Windows 2000 and Windows XP.

Yes, surely there is a better way.  My solution doesn't
work if the second application instance starts up before
the first instance has set up the DDE server.

Edi's links may be a better starting point.
