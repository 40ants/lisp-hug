                <h1>Optimization question</h1>
                <pre>
Is it possible to speed-up this code?

(defvar *global* 50)

(defun test (number iteration)
   (declare (optimize (speed 3) (safety 0) (debug 0) (space 0)))
   (declare (type (complex double-float) number))
   (or (&gt (the fixnum iteration) (the fixnum *global*))
       (&gt (the double-float (abs number)) 2.0d0)))

(defun test-times (iterations)
   (time (dotimes (x iterations) (test #c(0.5d0 0.8d0) 40))))

On LWM 5.0.1 Personal (Intel):

(time (test-times 10000000))

Timing the evaluation of (TEST-TIMES 10000000)

User time    =        9.557
System time  =        0.051
Elapsed time =       13.963
Allocation   = 800075272 bytes
0 Page faults

On SBCL on the same machine:

Evaluation took:
   0.803 seconds of real time
   0.794847 seconds of user run time
   0.0015 seconds of system run time
   0 calls to %EVAL
   0 page faults and
   0 bytes consed.

SBCL seems to be more than 10 times faster. Am I missing something? I  
double-checked that the functions are compiled.

Thanks,

Michal

Erm, put the loop into the function you've optimized? At the moment the 
loop is running in whatever the default optimization level is.

Other than the question of optimizing the loop, I'd be tempted to  
rebind the special variable as I suspect that access to specials is  
often not very fast.  Of course this only helps you is you can assume  
the special is a constant throughout the loop.  So you end up with  
some outer loop like:

(loop with global = *global*
       ...)
