                <h1>Small LispWorks 5.0.2 and Leopard issues</h1>
                <pre>
I've moved my main dev machine to Leopard and LW 5.0.2 works fine 
there. But after the move I've run into a a few small issues - 
seemingly preferences based, and I'm hoping someone will have some advice.

Whenever I launch LW, all the editor windows have their font size set 
to 9.9 points, instead of 10 point.  This makes it difficult to work 
with the text - LW won't completely draw every line, the cursors 
editing position doesn't match its visual position, etc.  The 
solution is to open the Window Preferences and change the font to 10 
points. I do this for the "All LispWorks Windows" setting.  That 
works for awhile, but eventually I'll open a new window and it'll be 
back to 9.9.    Also, my 10 point setting is not being stored. Every 
time I launch LW it is 9.9.   It's rather annoying.


Also, before Leopard, I had my LW keyboard configured for "Mac 
compatibility". Now when I launch LW it usually starts in Emacs 
compatibility mode. But, anecdotally, it seems that if I manually 
select a menu item (Save or Copy typically) then LW flips back to Mac 
compatibility mode for awhile. This isn't so bad - I'm familiar with 
all the emacs combos - the Mac chords are just more friendly and familar.


Both of these problems are clearly preferences or settings. Should I 
delete the .lispworks-config directory? Or some other file?

I too found the problem about printing lines and cursor messiness. I  
switched the font to Andale Mono instead of Monaco and that problem  
was cured. This did not however change the fractional business but at  
least I can read what I edit.
