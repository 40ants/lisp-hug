                <pre>
Dear lisp-hug list,

Is it possible to create a Lisp editor window in a LispWorks  
application ?
(in other word, how to create, from a Lisp function, an editor that  
would open a text buffer, or a text file, and allow for its edition  
and possible interactive evaluation, like in the LW editor window ?)

Thanks,

Jean Bresson

See

  http://weitz.de/regex-coach/

for a LispWorks application that uses editor panes extensively.

Edi.

One of the Lisp commands to edit a file is editor:find-file-command:

  (editor:find-file-command nil #p"/path/to/file")

Making sure that this command and the rest of the LW editor code makes
it into your delivered image is left as an exercise to the reader, as
is checking whether the Lispworks licensing agreement allows such a
thing.  :)  (Though if this is for your own use, it doesn't matter, of
course.)

I'm not sure about its behavior in delivered applications, but
LispWorks implements ED with useful results. You can use it to get an
editor with a buffer associated with no file, with an existing file,
or a new file.
