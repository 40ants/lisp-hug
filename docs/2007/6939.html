                <h1>ContextL Survey September 2007</h1>
                <pre>
Context-dependent behavior is becoming increasingly important for a  
wide range of application domains. Unfortunately, mainstream  
programming languages do not provide mechanisms that enable software  
entities to adapt their behavior dynamically to the current execution  
context. In collaboration with various researchers, we have developed  
a new programming technique called "Context-oriented Programming" (COP).

ContextL - http://common-lisp.net/project/closer/contextl.html - is  
our first fully implemented and currently most mature programming  
language extension for COP and is built on top of the Common Lisp  
Object System (CLOS). ContextL has first been made available to the  
public in early 2005, and has already been adopted by a number of  
programmers. We would now like to assess how well ContextL has been  
received so far.

Please consider participating in our first survey about ContextL -  
this will help us a lot to develop ContextL and related projects  
further (like Closer to MOP, etc.).

You can find the survey and more information about it at http:// 
prog.vub.ac.be/~pcostanza/COP/survey.html


Thanks a lot,
Pascal
