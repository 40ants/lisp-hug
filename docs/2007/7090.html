                <h1>Leopard issues - delivery level</h1>
                <pre>
Using Leopard on an Intel machine, applications made with a delivery  
level &gt 0 do not open.  These are the same applications that worked  
fine using Tiger.

I tried building the LispWorks delivery example (hello) which  
delivers at level 5. It too will not open unless the delivery level  
is 0.

I hope this is one of the issues that LispWorks will be addressing in  
the patches coming in a week or so.

I too just switched to Leopard, but I'm not having the problem you 
mention.  I have an app that I re-built at delivery level 4 and it 
worked fine.  I should note, though, that the app in question does 
not use CAPI.

I may follow up with some more info later. I have another app I'm in 
the midst of delivering that uses CAPI and at first blush it seems 
that setting the "quit-when-no-windows" delivery setting to nil is 
not working. I'll investigate and post to the list if I find a problem.

I've just confirmed this for CAPI applications.  I can only deliver 
them at level 0 using LispWorks 5.0.2 on Leopard.  With any other 
delivery level, the apps quit right away.

I've tried both setting the :quit-when-no-windows delivery setting to 
nil as well as opening a CAPI window in my startup loop. Neither make 
any difference.
