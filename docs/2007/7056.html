Hello Marc,

I'm currently deploying a new web application 
(tout arrive...) which means I haven't much 
feedback to provide regarding stability. However, 
looking for a good Linux distribution I have 
found that CentOS 5 was a good candidate. It's 
free, based on Red Hat EL 5 and seems to be used 
by many hosting companies. Until now I'm happy 
with it, including the documentation (Redhat) and 
the support provided by the CentOS forums (note: 
I'm new to Linux and haven't a sysadmin sous la 
main). Hardware: Dual core Intel, 2 disks, Raid1 
with 3ware 9650SE card. The application uses LW 
prof, Portable Aserve and PostgreSQL 8.1 (CLSQL). 
The server is still in test but will be on the web next week.

&gtHello,
&gt
&gtUntil now all my LWL web applications run on very old linux
&gtdistributions (2002/2003) and are compiled with LWL4.4
&gtThis have proved to be a very stable platform so far  with an uptime of
&gtalmost 100%. Not a crash in 5 years with a 24x7 usage.
&gtFor instance www.cl-user.net has been online, for almost 2 years now,
&gtwith the same LW process and has served more than 200M requests so far.
&gt
&gtNow I'm trying to move one of my banking application to a more uptodate
&gtplatform (RedHat Enterprise 4.1) on a dual quad core HP server with 4GB
&gtof RAM.
&gt
&gtUnfortunately, with LWL 5.0.2, I have run into several problems leading
&gtto crashes of the LW process. Of course each time the Lispwork's people
&gthave found and corrected the problems (even when the problem was outside
&gtLW in a postgresql .so library) but the problem is that now the sysadmin
&gtdon't even want to try again.
&gt
&gtSo I'm interested by feedback on what Linux distribution/platform/config
&gtpeople use for really stable and crash proof operation with LWL5.
&gtIn particular, info on RedHat distribs would be useful.
&gt
&gtThe application only uses LW, postgresql and apache/mod_lisp.
&gt
&gtThanks
&gt
&gtMarc

Hi!

We have racks of linux servers running LW, all with debian. Some still
have older debian versions, and they still run LW 4.4.*-based images,
but in my experience, the LW 5.0.2-based images are in general more
stable, and 64-bit LW 5.0.2 is even better. We're now aiming to move
most of our stuff that still runs with LW 4.4 directly to 64-bit, and
are extremely pleased with the performance and stability of 64-bit LW
5.0.2. 

We use Oracle as a database, though, so I can't comment on
postgressql.  We don't use mod_lisp either.

(regarding motif: We see some buggy behaviour every now and then,
 but OpenMotif is generally better than lesstif, and 5.0.* is no
 worse than 4.4.*)
