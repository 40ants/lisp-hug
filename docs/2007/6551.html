                <h1>reading big-endian float ?</h1>
                <pre>
I have some big endian 8 byte floating point numbers in a file I'm 
trying to read.  With a previous Lisp system I was using I just read 
those via a foreign function call to some C code that I had written to do it.


I'm guessing I could just use ldb on the mantissa and the exponent 
parts and then construct it, but before I go looking up how those are 
stored, exactly, I figured I should ask if there is a built in 
function in LispWorks for doing this.  Is there?

I tried apropos but didn't seem to find anything.

Or, does anyone have some code for this, or at least remember how the 
two parts are stored for a big endian double?

Chris

Maybe you can use this one as a starting point:
