Hear, hear!  :)

Well, you said *any* advice/ideas/direction so here's how I would
approach this (disclaimer: I haven't written any Windows UI code in LW
or anywhere else, but I've glanced at the CAPI docs and poked at the
Window Browser tool a bit):

- Write a sample app that opens a CAPI window, and figure out how to
  resize it programatically.
- Figure out how to get a handle to one of the IDE's windows.  The
  "Window Browser" tool may help with this.
- Combine steps one and two to resize an IDE window.

Just my $0.02.  Maybe other folks on the list can flesh out this
skeleton.
