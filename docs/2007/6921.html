                <h1>SDL and Lispworks on Mac</h1>I&#39;ve been using Lispworks with the SDL bindings in the lispbuilder-<span id="__firefox-findbar-search-id" style="padding: 0pt; background-color: yellow; color: black; display: inline; font-size: inherit;">sdl</span> project successfully for games running on Linux and Windows platforms.&nbsp; I&#39;m having trouble getting my game to work on the Mac and I&#39;m hoping someone has solved this problem before.&nbsp; 
<br><br>The problem is SDL requires cocoa wrapper code to run on the Mac.&nbsp; The wrapper creates a cocoa window for SDL and also handles passing events down to SDL.&nbsp; I&#39;ve tried several of the SDLMain.m wrappers out there, and I&#39;ve also tried the cocoahelper that comes with lispbuilder-
<span id="__firefox-findbar-search-id" style="padding: 0pt; background-color: yellow; color: black; display: inline; font-size: inherit;">sdl</span> and have had no success.&nbsp; I suspect that LispWorks isn&#39;t working because there is already an application window created by the IDE.
<br><br> When I launch my SDL game (without a wrapper) I get a new window, and SDL paints to it just fine.&nbsp; SDL events are not working though.&nbsp; Maybe all I need to do is connect the events, but I dont know enough about the internals of cocoa and SDL to do this.
<br><br>Has anyone ever had any success doing this?&nbsp; What would be really great is an CAPI:SDL-PANE, similar to the OpenGL pane in the examples.<br><br>I&#39;m using Lispworks Pro 5.02 on the Mac.<br><br>Thanks in advance,
<br><br>Anthony<br>
