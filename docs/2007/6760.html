&gt MAKE-INSTANCE is called with keyword :AXIOM-DEF among the
&gt arguments (OCML-RELATION :NAME ACTIVITY-PRECEDES :SCHEMA
....

We'll probably need a bit more context to be helpful, but I'll try and
give at least a very general answer.  That basic error means that the
code is trying to initialize the AXIOM-DEF slot/field in a class that
doesn't have a slot with that name.

According to your error message, you only have these slots available:

&gt :DOCUMENTATION :LISP-FUN :PRETTY-NAME :NAME :LISP-CLASS-NAME
&gt :LISP-SLOTS :CACHE-VALUES? :NO-OP :SUFFICIENT-FOR-TYPE-CHECKING
&gt :AVOID-INFINITE-LOOP :NO-PROOFS-BY :PROVE-BY :IFF-DEF :SUFFICIENT
&gt :CONSTRAINT :DEFINED-FROM-CLASS? :ARGUMENT-TYPES
&gt :DEFINED-FROM-DEF-RELATION :SCHEMA :ARITY

If you give us more information we can provide a better answer.

Cheers,
Chris Dean

I don't know anything about OCML, so I probably won't be much help.

&gt As i'm new using lispsworks, can u tell me how to trace an error
&gt such looping could not stop?

If the thing that is looping is in the top level LispWorks thread you
can just type control-c to interrupt it and that will drop you into
the debugger.  If it's not in the top thread (since it looks like it's
a TCP service) you'll need to attach to that thread first using the
LispWorks UI.

Frankly, this is all pretty advanced stuff.  Probably an easier way to
solve your problem is to contact the OCML author.

Good luck.

Cheers,
Chris Dean
