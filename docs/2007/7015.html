Has anyone figured out how Objective-C and Lisp exceptions interact?

	Thanks, Joel

                 <h1>Help using Profiler</h1>
                 <pre>
I am trying to use the graphical interface to the Profiler in LW5.  At one
point, I managed to observe the useful information I expected in the call
tree and cumulative windows.  But I am now unable to get it to display
anything.  I have tried adding various packages including "All". The
profiler preference is set to the package in which the code to profile
resides.

I'd appreciate any pointers to what the missing ingredient could be.

Mitch

Hi, Mitch.

It is so because you do not give the profiler enough runtime. Wrap your  
code in a cycle

(defmacro looper (num &amp;body code)
	(let ((j (gensym)))
		`(dotimes (,j ,num)
			@,code)))

(looper 10000 (+ 1 1))

Depending on how fast your machine is you might give num a value from a  
1000 up to 10000 to get some profiler output. Probably up to a million if  
your code is heavily optimized.

Thanks, Yury.  That was part of the problem.  

Less critical - but in the symbols select dialog, I do not see the symbols
from the package I have selected. Other symbols are there from the standard
packages though.

I have followed the Profiler example given in the LW User's Guide in Section
23.8 and I see no results from that either in LW 4.4.6 or 5.02 even with all
packages selected.

I am not sure at all what the problem is, to be honest. You either didn't  
run it for long enough or the calls are being hidden because they are  
below display treshold.
