                <h1>Keyboard shortcuts in LW 5.0.2 on Leopard</h1>
                <pre>
Guys and Gals,

I periodically loose some (if not all) of the keyboard shortcuts (in  
LW 5.0.2 on Leopard), e.g, Cut/Copy/Paste, Save, etc.
I can restore them by once choosing the appropriate menu item... but  
then after a while they stop working again. This happens also quite  
often when hiding/showing LW but it does not seem to be consistent.

I did try this even on a vanilla LW...

Has anybody else experienced this?

Yes, same here.

It seems to me that this is a problem with Leopard. Also, sometimes,  
Spaces get activated and Control+arrows starts to move between screen  
spaces, although I disabled that feature in system preferences. I  
recall reading that other people have that kind of problem as well,  
independent of LispWorks.

I guess these are the typical problems one encounters with beta  
releases of operating systems. :(
