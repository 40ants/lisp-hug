                <h1>X11 libraries loaded for console image on Mac OS X</h1>
                <pre>
I think I've seen similar questions in the past, but I can't seem to find
the answers now, so here's hoping that I'm not asking exactly the same
question.

I'm on Mac OS X with 4.4.5. I'm trying to save an image that I can use in
Emacs with SLIME. I'd like to be able to use CAPI and get graphical
objects displayed, etc., but I *don't* want the whole environment up.
I know that using the Cocoa LW will be hassle (menubars, keyboard
focus, etc) so I'm trying to use the X11 one.

I can save an X11 image that has multiprocessing enabled, and I can
either specify :environment nil and :multiprocessing t, but I don't get the
X11 libraries loaded. I seem to recall that there's a function that I could
call to get these loaded, but I don't recall what it *is*.

Does this sound like the right approach, and if so, what do I need to do
to make sure that the Xm libraries are loaded?

Ah, sorry to reply to mine own post, but a bit more Google-ing found
me

on

http://salaam.cs.buap.mx/IA/SOFTWARE/LISP_4_UNIX/readme-4450.txt

which was what I needed.
