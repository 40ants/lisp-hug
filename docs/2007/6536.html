In LWW 5.0.1 I see this behaviour:

  CL-USER 18 &gt (truename
                (make-pathname :name "app" 
                               :type "lisp"
                               :directory '(:absolute "tmp" :up "tmp")))
  #P"c:/tmp/../tmp/app.lisp"

  CL-USER 19 &gt (truename
                (make-pathname :name "app"
                               :type "lisp"
                               :directory '(:absolute "tmp" :back "tmp")))
  #P"c:/tmp/app.lisp"

If I understand 19.2.2.4.3 correctly (none of the directories involved
has multiple names), the results should be EQUAL, but they aren't.

So, is this a bug or am I missing something?

Sure.  That's why I said none of the directories involved has multiple
names.

I don't think I can think of a case where TRUENAME on a Unixoid FS  
would involve path components named "..", since there is always a  
better canonical name for any file, and TRUENAME is meant to find that.

I think it is.
