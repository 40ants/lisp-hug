Hi, I'm new to Lisp as well as Lispworks and I was wondering, does an
SSH 2.x/3.x and HTTP 1.1 packages exist?

Thanks in advance,

-Conrad

Not sure about SSH, but there are several HTTP clients and servers.
You can check out http://www.cliki.net/web for a list.

Personally, I use http://weitz.de/hunchentoot/ and
http://weitz.de/drakma/

Hi, I'm in the process of reorienting myself in regards to Lisp.
Thus, I thank you for the information.  Next, does Lisp supoort a
packaging system for search, downloading, and installing Lisp
packages?  I have been reading about ASDF but it seems that it handles
the local package stuff only.  Also, I just want to install the
packages in a default location.  For example, I would like to do
something like this:

(cl:package install cl-http)  ;; installs the Lisp package

(clos:package list) ;; lists all the packages installed locally

or

(cl:package list :locale local) ;; lists all the packages installed locally

(cl:package list :locale remote) ;; lists all the packages on the remote server

(cl:package search cl-ssh :local remote);;  search for a package-name
'cl-ssh' on the remote server

This cl:package package will have to be included in the default load
of your Lisp system to access this functionality.  In any case, I
guess I can use either HTTP or Curl which ever is easiest to
integrate.

I think ASDF Install is what you're looking for.

Not that asdf install does all you want :), it just is the closest
thing there is.  Finding the right package for your problem can still
be challenging.

Hey Chris, thanks for the information and it is definitely the
closest.  Does everyone within the Lisp community subscribe to using
ASDF for publishing packages?  In any case, I'll take a look at the
documentation and go from there.

Thanks again,

-Conrad

You might want to have a look at S-HTTP-CLIENT and S-HTTP-SERVER:

	http://homepage.mac.com/svc/s-http-client/
	http://homepage.mac.com/svc/s-http-server/

The first Lisp Movie on the following page is a demo/tutorial:

	http://homepage.mac.com/svc/LispMovies/index.html

Both packages can handle HTTPS 1.1 on LispWorks.

There are many HTTP client and server packages out there,
I wrote these myself partially for educational purposes.
Their quality is OK: I am using them in production situations.
One advantage might be that the codebase isn't that big and
reasonable readable. The documentation is not as good as some others.

HTH,

Sven
