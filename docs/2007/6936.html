                <h1>[ANN] YstokGrid 1.1 - CAPI-based grid widget</h1>
                <pre>
Hello lispworkers,

This is the minor release of YstokGrid, a graphical user interface widget
based on the CAPI library for LispWorks(R).

YstokGrid, or YGrid for short, is distributed under a LLGPL style license.

    http://lisp.ystok.ru/ygrid/

YGrid  was developed and tested on LispWorks 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, and 5.0 for
Windows.
Compatibility with Linux or Mac must not be of much effort due to code
conditionalized with the :win32 feature.

General
-------
YGrid provides convenient GUI framework for working with data in tabular
form. The main design purpose was to present RDBMS records in rows. With
YGrid,
you can edit in place, add, or delete records. YGrid can be included into
any
CAPI interface window as an ordinary pane.

Basic Features
- Text display, text input, and check button columns.
- Enabled or read-only columns.
- Ghost columns, i.e. calculated from the values of other columns.
- Callbacks on interactive user actions.
- Selecting rows with various styles of choice-interaction via a row header.
- Column width and row height changeable via a mouse gesture or
  programmatically.
- Assigning graphics args (foreground or background color, font etc.) to
every
  cell differentially.
- Sorting and filtering rows.
- Searching a single column via a kind of "Find what" dialog.
- Standard records menu and toolbar.
- Undo changes performed on cell or entire record.

Text Display Column Features
- Rendering static text.
- Number and currency format localization; automatic initialization of
locale-specific parameters on Windows.
- Horizontal alignment: left, center, or right.
- Wrapping text automatically.

Text Input Column Features (additional to static text)
- Customizable print-function, read and write converters.
- Full-fledged capi:editor-pane used for editing cell values.

Check Column Features
- Boolean or triple state check boxes.
- Toggling via mouse or keyboard.

What Is New in Release 1.1
--------------------------
- Adapted and tested for LispWorks 5.0:
-- for LW5, editing pane font can be of variable width.
-- for LW5, cursor files are loaded during compilation and are no longer
   needed in run-time.
- Added the leftmost non-scrollable (aka frozen) columns feature,
  which is controllable by the left-frozen-ncols slot of the ygrid class.
  they are always visible when scrolling horizontally similar to
  the row header.
- Added several event generics and callbacks.

Bug reports and suggestions are welcome.

Sincerely,
Dmitriy Ivanov
