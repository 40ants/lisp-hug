                <pre>
Has anyone implemented the Java RMI protocol or been able to connect  
Lisp to an app server like JBoss or Weblogic?

	Thanks, Joel

I believe that Sven has successfully connected to jboss using jfli,

I think from my investigations of RMI a year ago, I discovered that RMI
was rather intimitely tied into Java's serialization protocol.

http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/rmi/spec/rmi-protocol4.html

So I doubt getting CL to talk RMI would be trivial, though it would be
an awesome hack.

&gt In theory RMI can be made to use IIOP which is CORBA's native protocol.  
&gt Then you can speak CORBA to JBoss.

There are a couple of interfaces to java.
