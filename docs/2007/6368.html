                <h1>CAPI issues</h1>
                <pre>
Hi,

I'm working on a fun project involving some visualization. With
LispWorks Personal 5.0 (a great tool, by me) I'm using CAPI. However,
the CAPI reference guide is not very detailed about actual interfaces
and behaviours of the classes there.

Google searches so far have mainly resulted in references to the
document already mentioned above. Is there anything more comprehensive
available?

Thanks in advance
Villem

You might want to start out with the CAPI User manual.
In it you'll find the basic examples of how to do common
things, and you'll get a much better idea of how to use
the things described in the reference manual. You might
have a copy with your installation, but you can also find
it here:

Villem,

Edi Weitz has created a great overview of CAPI classes.

see

http://www.weitz.de

or more precise

http://www.weitz.de/capi-overview/

CAPI documentation is not very detailed. The LispWorks Class Browser and the
browsable archive of this mailing list at

http://news.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.lispworks.general/

can be your friends.

Andreas

And, don't forget to look at the examples directory.
