                <h1>List Buffers command in MacOS X editor</h1>
                <pre>
Hello,

When in buffers list pane after executing  "List Buffers" command in  
the editor (macosx only, on windows it works), i can navigate with  
keyboard arrow keys, but cannot switch to the selected buffer by  
pressing a key (tried Enter, Return, Space, Hyper-o, Control-o and  
about any other shortcut). I can only switch to a buffer by  
doubleclicking. Do you experience this also? Is there a workaround/ 
fix? Does it drive you crazy?


Thank you, Denis.

Normally on Mac OS X one cycles editor *windows* with command-`.  
Unfortunately by default, LispWorks opens new editor buffers in the  
same window which is very un-mac-like and really annoying. One  
workaround is to bind control-` to cycle buffers so I can cycle though  
*buffers* in one window as I would cycle through editor *windows* in a  
standard mac text editing application:

(editor:bind-key "Circulate Buffers" #\control-\` :global :mac)

Alternatively, use System Preferences:Keyboard &amp; Mouse:Keyboard  
Shortcuts to bind something like command-shift-n to Editor (from the  
menu Window:Tools:Editor - but only enter the last bit in Keyboard  
Shortcuts, not the whole menu path). Then you can use this keyboard  
shortcut to create a new editor window and *then* open your file in  
it. This way each file is associated with it's own editor window.

Sadly, even this doesn't work 100% reliably - for some reason  
LispWorks will need you to cycle windows or click in the menu bar  
before issuing this key command to get it to work. Other times there's  
no problem.

Or you can just not buck the system and use circulate buffers bound to  
the keystroke of your choice as above.

&gt Does it drive you crazy?


yes - can you tell? ;^)

Ralph

I filed a bug report for this in 2004 (IMPACT: Annoying :).

My solution was to develop an editor function that pops up a menu of  
buffers. This supports type-ahead, arrow keys, and return key to select.

                  <h1>Finding bounds of graphics port drawing</h1>
                  <pre>
I would like to find the bounds of objects drawn in a graphics port. It
looks like gp:get-bounds should do that, but in the example below, only nil
is returned. I thought it would return the bounding rectangle of the line
drawn in the pane.

(capi:define-interface test-bounds ()
  ()
  (:panes
   (opane capi:output-pane))
  (:layouts
   (row1 capi:row-layout
         '(opane)
         :visible-min-width 200
         :visible-min-height 200))
  (:default-initargs
   :layout 'row1))

(capi:display (setf xxx (make-instance 'test-bounds)))

(gp:draw-line (slot-value xxx 'opane) 10 10 50 50)

(gp:get-bounds (slot-value xxx 'opane))

I see now that I need to use gp:with-pixmap-graphics-port.

                    <pre>
gp:get-bounds does not account for the pen thickness when calculating the
bounds of a drawn entity if the thickness is specifed as a keyword in the
drawing function.  It does take it into account if the thickness is changed
in the graphics state of the port. Here is an example with lines of two
different thicknesses specified in the draw function.
