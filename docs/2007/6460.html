I cannot speak about the services menu, but drag and drop is definitely working in LispWorks. We have a working DnD implementation for CAPI (on Win32 and Mac OSX).

ciao,

Which means you've hacked your own DnD support on top of LW which is
integrated with CAPI?  And completely/mostly in Lisp?  Any plans to
release that?

Cheers,
Edi.

I think you misunderstood me. I said that using the standard cocoa  
means to register for dragged types does not work in either an  
ordinary CAPI pane, nor in  a capi:cocoa-view-pane. It *does* work if  
you load a window from a .nib file, and then call  
registerForDraggedTypes: but this means *not* using CAPI.

As Edi said, if you have DnD working with CAPI on OS X it is because  
you hacked up your own implementation, not because the normal,  
usually one line, simple cocoa means of registering for drags works  
with CAPI. It does not. Again, it works with .nib based windows, but  
*not* with capi:cocoa-view-panes or ordinary capi views.

Similarly, since LispWorks main menu is *not* loaded from a .nib, but  
rather constructed programmatically, it is therefore responsible for  
installing a services menu - something you essentially get for free  
if you load your main menu from a .nib rather than construct it  
programmatically. LispWorks is not installing a services menu.

from &lt;http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ 
SysServices/Concepts/menu.html&gt

"The Services menu is included in the default nib file created by  
Xcode and Interface Builder for Cocoa applications. If the  
application’s menu is instead created programmatically, you need to  
designate a Services menu using the NSApplication method  
setServicesMenu:. If an application registers for services (see  
“Using Services”), the appropriate items are automatically available  
in the Services menu."

The means of doing so programmatically are described here: &lt;http:// 
developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/SysServices/Tasks/ 
using.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000854-CEGDDHJJ&gt
