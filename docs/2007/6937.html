                <h1>Reference eligibility for garbage collection across a function call</h1>
                <pre>
This may be Win32 specific:

I am wondering if there is a strict definition or understanding around
of what makes data eligible for garbage collection.  Clearly (as one
of my examples shows), LW can make an item eligible the last time it
can possibly be accessed, not necessarily keeping it around in
"scope".  In my example, I pass a huge list from test2 to test, and in
the defun example does the list gets cleared mid-function in the
clean-down.

However, in the defmethod example, the outer test2 function call (or
something else) seems to keep the parameter eligible for garbage
collection

What makes the defmethod work differently, and is this phenomenon
documented anywhere?

Thanks,
Matt

(defmacro do-compiled (&amp;rest rest)

     (lambda ()
       ,@rest))))

; Example 1
(do-compiled
 (defun test (list)
   (print "Press ENTER to CLEAN-DOWN")
   (read-line)
   (hcl:clean-down)
   (print "Extra memory should be cleared - Press ENTER to EXIT")
   (read-line))

 (defun test2 ()
   (hcl:clean-down)
   (test (make-list 10000000)))
 )

(test2)



; Example 2

(do-compiled
 (defmethod test (list)
   (print "Press ENTER to CLEAN-DOWN")
   (read-line)
   (hcl:clean-down)
   (print "10000000 element list should still be hogging ram - Press
ENTER to EXIT")
   (read-line))

 (defmethod test2 ()
   (hcl:clean-down)
   (test (make-list 10000000)))
 )

(test2)

One obvious difference between a normal function and generic function  
call is what the compiler can know about possible references to  
objects.  For instance, in something like (the compiled code of)

(defun foo (x) (print "x not referenced"))

It's a pretty safe bet that, well, X is really not referenced by the  
function.

But that assumption is *not* safe for this:

(defmethod foo (x) (print "x not referenced"))

Because

(defmethod foo :after (x) (format t "~&amp;I lied: x is ~A~%" x))

The only way of *knowing* whether arguments to generic functions are  
used is knowing all the methods that exist *or might ever exist* for  
the GF.  Absent sealing, you can never know the latter.
