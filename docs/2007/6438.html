                <h1>Delivery with LWW 5.0.1</h1>
                <pre>
Hi,

Can anybody point me to or give information on which Windows versions still
are supported by LWW 5.0.1? 

I have a customer with XP, Win 2000 and Win 98 machines.

After installing Windows Installer 3.1 and vcredist_x86 my app cause the
following error on a Win 2000 pro machine:

Warning: Got an error 'Foreign function WIN32::GET-NATIVE-SYSTEM-INFO trying
to
call to unresolved external function "GetNativeSystemInfo".'
while executing action "Reset Location and Args" in list "Reset FFI on
startup".

Error: The file "dekl-init" does not exist.
  1 (continue) Try loading dekl-init again.
  2 Give up loading dekl-init.
  3 Try loading another file instead of dekl-init.
  4 (abort) Quit process.

Type :b for backtrace, :c &lt;option number&gt to proceed,  or :? for other
options

Any ideas?


Andreas

(rem.: the file dekl-init.lisp does exist. XP machines with the same
configuration don't show a problem)

I only recently installed 5.0 and 5.01 LWW and have had troubles during the 
install and with my scripts on Win2000.

The trouble seems to be with relative pathnames.  Stuff that used to work in 
4.x, like '(load "defsys")' fails.

The temporary work-around seems to be to specify the full pathname.

Likewise, I just got exactly the same error as yours above.  I got past that 
error by specifying a fully-qualified path to the -init arg.

[The fact that you have reported the same problem might imply that it's a bug 
or something else missing under win2k]
