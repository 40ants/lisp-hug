Important Dates:
****************

* Submission of research papers: February 11, 2008
* Work-in-progress papers:          March 24, 2008
* Author notification:               April 7, 2008
* First final versions due:         April 28, 2008

Accepted research papers will be invited for a special issue of the  
Journal
of Universal Computer Science (J.UCS). See symposium website for more  
details.


Scope:
******

The European Lisp Symposium 2008 invites high quality papers about novel
research results, insights and lessons learned from practical  
applications,
and educational perspectives, all involving Lisp dialects, including  
Common
Lisp, Scheme, ISLISP, Dylan, and so on.

Topics include, but are not limited to:

* Language design and implementation techniques
* Language integration, interoperation and deployment
* Experience reports and case studies
* Reflection and meta-level architectures
* Educational approaches
* Software adaptation and evolution
* Configuration management
* Artificial intelligence
* Large and ultra-large-scale systems
* Development methodologies
* Development support and environments
* Persistent systems
* Scientific computing
* Parallel and distributed computing
* Data mining
* Semantic web
* Dynamic optimization
* Innovative applications
* Hardware and virtual machine support
* Domain-oriented programming

We also encourage submissions about past approaches that have been  
largely
forgotten about, as long as they are presented in a new setting.

We invite submissions in two categories:
original contributions and work-in-progress papers.

*** Original contributions have neither been published previously nor  
are
under review by other refereed events or publications. Research papers  
should
describe work that advances the current state of the art, or presents  
old
results from a new perspective. Experience papers should be of broad  
interest
and should describe insights gained from substantive practical  
applications.
The program committee will evaluate each contributed paper based on its
relevance, significance, clarity, and originality.

Accepted papers will be published in the Journal of Universal Computer  
Science
(J.UCS). Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their work  
at the
symposium main track in Bordeaux on May 23, 2008.

*** Work in progress describes ongoing work that is not ready for  
publication
yet, but would benefit strongly from feedback by other researchers,
practitioners and educators. Such contributions will not be published  
in the
symposium proceedings, but will be made available at the symposium  
website.
The work-in-progress track will be organized as a series of writers'  
workshops
where authors work together to improve their papers. Some authors who  
submit
papers for the main track will be suggested to contribute their work  
in this
track instead, if the program committee decides that their submission  
is not
yet ready for a publication.

The writers' workshops will take place at the symposium in Bordeaux on
May 22, 2008.


Submissions:
************

Papers for the main track must be submitted electronically, preferably  
as PDF
or PostScript file (level 1 or 2). However, submissions in RTF or Word  
format
are also accepted. Initial submissions may not exceed 15 pages in the  
J.UCS
style, including all appendices. (Invited papers for the journal  
publication
will have a page limitation of 25 pages in the same format.) See the  
symposium
website for more details, including about the submission procedure.

Papers for the work-in-progress track may be in PDF, PostScript level  
1 or 2,
RTF or Word, and may not exceed 25 pages. There are no further  
requirements on
their format. Papers for the work-in-progress track must be sent via  
email to
pascal.costanza@vub.ac.be.
