Scope:
******

The Dynamic Languages Symposium (DLS) at OOPSLA 2007 in Montreal,
Canada, is a forum for discussion of dynamic languages, their
implementation and application. While mature dynamic languages including
Smalltalk, Lisp, Scheme, Self, and Prolog continue to grow and inspire
new converts, a new generation of dynamic scripting languages such as
Python, Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript are successful in a wide range of
applications. DLS provides a place for researchers and practitioners to
come together and share their knowledge, experience, and ideas for
future research and development.

DLS 2007 invites high quality papers reporting original research,
innovative contributions or experience related to dynamic languages,
their implementation and application. Accepted Papers will be published
in the OOPSLA conference companion and the ACM Digital Library.

Areas of interest include but are not limited to:
*************************************************

* Innovative language features and implementation techniques
* Development and platform support, tools
* Interesting applications
* Domain-oriented programming
* Very late binding, dynamic composition, and runtime adaptation
* Reflection and meta-programming
* Software evolution
* Language symbiosis and multi-paradigm languages
* Dynamic optimization
* Hardware support
* Experience reports and case studies
* Educational approaches and perspectives
* Object-oriented, aspect-oriented, and context-oriented programming

Submissions and proceedings
***************************

We invite original contributions that neither have been published
previously nor are under review by other refereed events or
publications. Research papers should describe work that advances the
current state of the art. Experience papers should be of broad interest
and should describe insights gained from substantive practical
applications. The program committee will evaluate each contributed paper
based on its relevance, significance, clarity, and originality.

Papers are to be submitted electronically at
http://www.dcl.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/dls2007/ in PDF format.
Submissions must not exceed 12 pages and need to use the ACM format,
templates for which can be found at
http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html.
