                <pre>
Hello all

I've just started delivering an app for the first time using
5.01. Previously it delivered cleanly at level 5 using 5.00 with no
delivery keywords (it's a simple utility) but now I get the following
error and the delivery fails.

Shaking stage : Starting delivery
Error: There are advice definitions for the following functions:
EDITOR:FIND-SOURCE-FOR-DSPEC-COMMAND
EDITOR:FIND-COMMAND-DEFINITION-COMMAND
EDITOR::EDIT-CALLEES-COMMAND
EDITOR::FIND-PATTERN
EDITOR:CONTINUE-TAGS-SEARCH-COMMAND
EDITOR:FIND-SOURCE-COMMAND
EDITOR::QUERY-REPLACE-STRING
EDITOR:FIND-ALTERNATE-FILE-COMMAND
EDITOR:TAGS-SEARCH-COMMAND
EDITOR:FIND-TAG-COMMAND
EDITOR::EDIT-CALLERS-COMMAND
EDITOR::FIND-NEXT-ORDINARY-WINDOW
EDITOR:PROMPT-FOR-FILE
ASDF::PARSE-COMPONENT-FORM
Use the :KILL-DSPEC-TABLE NIL option to DELIVER if you need to keep
them.

(After this various calls and the delivery quits)

There is a mention of :kill-dspec-table in the release notes but that
seems to mention it as a warning and the above message also hints that
this keyword is optional. Given that I don't rely on the editor or asdf
is there any reason why the delivery fails? If I set the flag to nil then
it delivers and runs fine but ends up at over 10 megs in size, under 5.0
the binary was about 5 1/2 megs.

    cheers

        Andrew

Are you using DEFADVICE?

I forgot to mention: I've seen this as well.  An application which
delivered fine at level 5 with LWW 4.4.6 now needs :KILL-DSPEC-TABLE
NIL (because it uses DEFADVICE) and the resulting binary has increased
significantly in size.
