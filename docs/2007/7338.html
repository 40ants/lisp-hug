Disclaimer: I don't do CAPI programming, but I found your question
quite fascinating and read your code and most of the CAPI User Guide
section on Graphics Ports.  So hopefully my comments/questions will
make sense, but possibly not.

Graphics Ports have transforms designed to do scaling.  I think you
could

- Draw to a special variable *off-screen-port* instead of a
  lexically-defined off-screen-port.
- Store a closure that does the drawing instead of the coordinates of
  the drawing operation.  That means you can do any drawing operations
  whatsoever without storing all the coordinates of each individual
  drawing operation.  (I think.  :)
- On resize, bind *off-screen-port* to a different port, set up the
  appropriate scaling on the port, and call all the closures you've
  stored.  (Or, if necessary, set the scaling individually for each
  operation.  Not sure exactly how that'd work out.  Might require you
  to pre-scale all the "original" drawing operations to some large
  coordinate system, and then re-scale them down to the actual port
  size, for each operation.  Or something like that.  Did I mention I
  don't do CAPI programming?  :)

Admittedly, you're basically reinventing the internal metafile, but
this approach at least seems a little easier than yours.  (And it'd
work under Unix, too.)

Anyway, hope this helps, or at least makes sense.  :)

Hi

I have not looked at your code yet, but I did fiddle with these  
things a long time ago when working on cl-plot (a CAPI plotting library)
I think I posted the code here at some point.

If you want to see some screenshots you can look here http:// 
bioinformatics.nyu.edu/Projects/GOALIE/#Screenshots
The plots (the panes which contain plots) in the interface are fully  
scalable.

Cheers

marco

Why are you drawing to an off-screen port (or metafile)?

I would have expected the gp:draw-xxx code to be in the display-callback, 
wrapped within a gp:with-graphics-scale.  I would have expected the resize 
callback to calculate the zoom factor, stuff it into an instance variable and 
to call gp:invalidate-rectangle (which then causes the display-callback to be 
fired).

eg.

(defun display-callback (...)
  (let ((intf (capi:element-interface pane)))
    (gp:with-graphics-scale (pane (zoom intf) (zoom intf))
        (gp:draw-line ....)
        (gp:draw-line ....) ...)))

(defun resize-callback (...)
  (setf (zoom intf) (your-calculation-here))
  (gp:invalidate-rectangle pane))


(Use x,y,w,h in display-callback and invalidate-rectangle if you need to 
optimize by not drawing to regions outside of the visible window (clipped)).

The only reason I see for using an off-screen port is to perform 
double-buffering (to get rid of tearing effects during lengthy graphic 
manipulations).  In which case, have you looked at capi:with-atomic-redisplay 
(example balloons.lisp)?


Another option:

I am working on something like this at this very moment (so feel free to 
discuss with me - we'll both learn something :-).  

The background of my window is generated (in a C dll) using a very expensive 
operation, sometimes needing a few seconds to generate it.  I've optimized 
the "damage" events (cover, uncover portions of the window - stuff that 
should not require a complete recalculation of the background) by taking a 
snapshot of the window once the C program is done scribbling on the window.  
I use gp:make-image-from-port to grab the result as an image and stick it 
into an instance variable (cache).  Then, in the display callback, I use 
gp:draw-image to slap the cached background into the window, inside a call to 
gp:with-graphics-scale.  This works (on Windows at least).

Hi Paul,

That will work with a static image that is known in advance, but not
in my case.  It was probably not totally clear from my initial
question, but what I'm looking for is the best way to handle a
situation where something is drawn to the pane, it is then resized,
some more stuff is drawn, it is resized again, and so on.

Sounds like a good plan... :)

Ah, thanks, that gave me something new to think about.  I wasn't aware
that you could scale images that you grabbed that way.  For some
reason, I thought the images acquired with MAKE-IMAGE-FROM-PORT were
pixel-by-pixel copies of the port.

Thanks,
Edi.

Yes, something like this will certainly also work, but it again boils
down to "keep track of the drawing history yourself."  That's the part
I was trying to avoid... :)
