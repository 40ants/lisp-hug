                <h1>position of a non-visible window</h1>
                <pre>
Hi

is it possible set or get the size of a window (pane) that has not  
been displayed ?

It is, I make a window by evaluating

(setf mywindow (make-instance 'capi:interface :x 10 :y 20))
#&lt;CAPI:INTERFACE NIL 200DFFF3&gt

now I want to set the position of mywindow to x=50 and y=50 and then  
when I execute

(display mywindow)

The window appears at position (50,50)

thanks for your help

Carlos Agon

It's turns out to be a tricky question, actually.

According to the inspector the display coordinates of an Interface are  
contained in a slot called HINT-TABLE with a value similar to '(:X 50 :Y  
50). It is possible to change the values in the inspector and it works but  
this slot seems to be unaccessible to any of the CLOS operators. For  
example (SLOT-VALUE SOME-INTERFACE 'HINT-TABLE) drops you into the  
debugger.

I would consider it be a bug in the implementation. While it is addressed  
you'll probably have to initialize the window only when you need to  
display it.

Are you sure you used the right package qualifiers?

  CL-USER 1 &gt (apropos "hint-table")
  CAPI::HINT-TABLE (defined)
  CAPI:SET-HINT-TABLE (defined)
  SETF::\"CAPI\"\ \"HINT-TABLE\" (defined)

  CL-USER 2 &gt (capi:contain (make-instance 'capi:title-pane :title "foo"))
  #&lt;CAPI:TITLE-PANE "" 21C746D3&gt

  CL-USER 3 &gt (slot-value * 'capi::hint-table)
  (:VISIBLE-MAX-HEIGHT T :VISIBLE-MAX-WIDTH T :VISIBLE-MIN-WIDTH :TEXT-WIDTH)

Hmm...

Which symbol was created in the USER package and by what operation?

You might be able to do this easily using the :create-callback  
initarg. At this point, the pane is instantiated but not yet displayed.
