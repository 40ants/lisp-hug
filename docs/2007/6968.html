                <h1>Tips on coding for performance</h1>
                <pre>
Hello list,

I have written a prototype for a voice-over-IP-style 
application. It uses the PortAudio and Intel Performance 
Primitives (IPP) libraries and UDP sockets and seems to work 
fairly well. However, the production version will need to be 
a bit more efficient.

I'm new to Lisp/LispWorks optimisation, and I'm looking for 
a few pointers to get me started. Which of the following 
should I be looking at? (I haven't tried the profiler yet, 
but I will do so; I just wanted to get this email off first.)

* Methods vs. functions: I have used a lot of classes &amp; 
methods; should I use ordinary functions instead of generic 
functions when there's only one method? Or indeed structs 
instead of classes?

My design is based on an implementation of hierarchical 
state machines where each "state" is a function or a method, 
so there's quite a bit of invocation of the function bound 
to a symbol at runtime. My "compiler" could use either 
classes &amp; methods or functions &amp; structs, depending on 
whether there's much difference in performance to be had.

* Type declarations: none yet. Are these best near FLI 
wrappers and/or in tight loops, or should I just go through 
the whole thing and add them everywhere? How much does the 
compiler infer itself?

* Pooling resources &amp; memory: is foreign memory much more 
expensive to allocate &amp; GC than the Lisp heap? Are the MP 
locks cheap to get &amp; release, or should I have thread-safe &amp; 
-unsafe pools?

If anyone has any additional advice, I would be very grateful.

Thanks very much,

John :^P

The best advice is very simple and almost banal: profile your code and
improve the slow bits.  All my general advice will just be variations
on that theme.

The path you're going down of running the profiler is the right thing
imo.  Once the profiler gives you an idea of where improvements can be
made, just timing a consistent test case outside of the profiler has
been very effective for me.

You can also dissemble a function to see if the compiler is doing what
you expect.

As for your specific questions:

&gt * Methods vs. functions

This is very rarely a performance consideration with my code -- it
happens but not often.

&gt structs instead of classes?

Class accessors are generally very fast.

&gt My design is based on an implementation of hierarchical state machines
&gt where each "state" is a function or a method

If you know what to do at compile time using macros to unroll your
state machine can lead to very good code.  If you only know what your
state machine should look like at run time a common way to encode a
state machine is to use a hierarchy of closures.  See SICP (and many
others; here's another example http://xach.livejournal.com/131456.html)

&gt * Type declarations

Type declarations can dramatically improve some code, but you'll need
to test if it helps your code.

&gt should I just go through the whole thing and add [types] everywhere?

Don't do that :).  Just add them in the slow parts where they help.

&gt * Pooling resources &amp; memory: is foreign memory much more expensive to
&gt   allocate &amp; GC than the Lisp heap? Are the MP locks cheap to get &amp;
&gt   release, or should I have thread-safe &amp; -unsafe pools?

No idea, sorry.  Using less overall memory is a good general principle
though.  (Some of my slower programs have been ones that allocated
huge amounts of garbage.)

Good luck!

Cheers,
Chris Dean

Hello John,

the only thing I would add to the existing fine suggestions is something
you can do by inspection as well as profiling - try to minimize your
garbage generation.  Simply put, do you create a lot of lists and throw
them away?  Or big objects, structures, arrays?  I once speeded up my
program by two orders of magnitude by creating one large array and re-using
it rather than making a new one every time and throwing it away.

Note that this is not as simple as it seems and depends critically on  
the GC in use.  For instance, a simple-minded copying GC is actually  
a live-object-copier and not really a garbage collector at all.  In  
particular if the GC runs when there are *no* live objects, it has no  
work to do, while if it runs when there is a lot of live stuff, it  
has to copy a lot of data which takes time and also may cause bad  
cache pressure.  Of course pretty much no-one uses such a simple- 
minded collector, and I think that LW's does some clever trickery  
with large objects which are allocated in such a way that it will not  
have to copy them.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that this, like  
everything, is something you need to measure: don't assume you  
understand what takes time...

I'll chime in too... I think you need to use the profiler asap.  I've
almost always been surprised when using the profiler on a slow
application, e.g. I /knew/ I had a frequently used function with a
stupid, slow implementation, and then the profiler shows me that it
accounts for just 0.1% of the cpu usage.

&gt * Methods vs. functions: I have used a lot of classes &amp; 
&gt methods; should I use ordinary functions instead of generic 
&gt functions when there's only one method? Or indeed structs 
&gt instead of classes?

Don't do anything with this before you know you have to
(I don't think you'll end up changing it).

&gt * Type declarations: none yet. Are these best near FLI 
&gt wrappers and/or in tight loops, or should I just go through 
&gt the whole thing and add them everywhere? How much does the 
&gt compiler infer itself?

Not everywhere! Only do this where it really makes sense (e.g. I have
a server application that has to compute 5 million correlations, each
based on 2x500-element vectors, within reasonable time, the
correlation and standard deviation functions are heavily optimised
with floating-point declarations, but the bulk of the application has
no declarations).

&gt * Pooling resources &amp; memory: is foreign memory much more 
&gt expensive to allocate &amp; GC than the Lisp heap? Are the MP 
&gt locks cheap to get &amp; release, or should I have thread-safe &amp; 
&gt -unsafe pools?

I don't know how you're going to use the locks, but my experience
is that they are really cheap to get &amp; release (on linux, both
with and without pthreads (lw 5 and 4)) (which version and OS
are you using?)

Other things to look out for:

- Look for excessive consing, and consider if you would be better off
  using vectors instead of lists 
- Avoid medium-lived long lists, especially FIFO queues implemented as
  lists (LW has pushed me on this for a while, finally I'm replacing
  them with vectors :-)) - they're expensive to handle for the GC.
- Watch out for slow iteration (maphash/loop) on big hash tables! They get
  locked, and your application may stall completely!

I'll second Espen's remarks. The Lispworks profiler is your very dear friend, and you'll probably be surprised where your tuning efforts really need to go.

Beyond profiling, minimizing (or eliminating!) repeated consing  
(memory allocation) will likely pay off, particularly for a real-time  
application like VOIP. Declare selected bindings to have dynamic  
extent, and use pooling (like you mention below). to reuse temporary  
objects.
