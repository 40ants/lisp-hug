Hi,

my app works correctly when interpreted and when compiled in the IDE. When
delivering simply with

(load-all-patches)
(load "dekl-ld")
(deliver 'main "dekl2" 0 :interface :capi)
(quit)

a test ride crashes with the following message:

; Loading text file c:\devel\lisp\sketch\dekl\dekl-init.lisp
Setting Oracle converters

Error: No representation for #&lt;SIMPLE-FORM FORM 20684F84&gt needed by

options

CL-USER 2 : 1 &gt

What does this message "no representation" mean (I have no clue). Am I
missing something essential 
on capi delivery (I use no packages - at the moment I have nearly everything
in CL-USER)?

This was a test with non compiled sources. The compiled version show same
behaviour.

Any comments or hints welcome (before I post more of the code)

Thanks Andreas

LWW 4.4.6

I think it means that it doesn't have the Windows equivalent (some kind
of window handle) of some CAPI pane.  Now /why/ it doesn't have that handle
is a more difficult question.  It smells of a multi-threading problem to
me, but that's just a guess.

Arthur,

thanks for your hints. 

I just made my app runnable under LWW 5.
The problem simply vanished - thus it seems to be an LWW 4.4.6 issue.

Andreas
