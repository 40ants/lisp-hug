Hi Joel, welcome!

What brought you 'over' ? What is the IDE after all ?
You're on Mac, right ? I think that as a development environment on  
Mac, LW has no competition.

&gt Personally, I run the LW IDE and use Emacs for editing. I can't use
&gt the LW editor, it's too strange for me and I don't care to spend the
&gt time to adjust the bindings.

I think that's a big mistake.  I'm mentioning this because I had the
same misconception for quite some time and I also used Emacs/SLIME
instead of (or in additon to) the LispWorks IDE.  Finally, after one
or two years of fiddling about, I switched over to the LispWorks IDE
completely and I never regretted it.  Even without modifications, the
editor is quite similar to Emacs.  It still has a couple of quirks
that bug me from time to time, but I can live with them.  (Not that I
wouldn't be happy if they went away.  LispWorks, are you listening?)

I still use GNU Emacs for almost everything else, so I know what I'm
talking about.  SLIME is cool, but whenever I have to use it with
another Lisp like SBCL or CMUCL, I know what I'm missing in terms of
IDE support.

As far as spending a few hours to tweak your working environment is
concerned, it is certainly wrong to try to skip this part and instead
to suffer for years.  But I guess every hacker has to learn that
himself.

I wholeheartedly agree. I guess the only thing with the editor that
/really/ irritates me, is that control-X 2 doesn't do what I want
it to do. Two or more buffers in the same window can be really useful
from time to time...

I've used the IDE all the time, but I grew up with several emacs-
flavoured editors from the beginning (my first emacsen were FINE and
AMIS on tops-10, followed by the original TECO-based emacs on tops-20,
not much later I started using FRED on MACL 1.&lt;something&gt :-)), so I
guess I'm just used to the fact that emacs-style editing doesn't have
to be done in the One True Emacs.

&gt I still use GNU Emacs for almost everything else

Me too, e.g. I also use PCL-CVS in GNU Emacs for version handling, and
the fact that I can't do this inside the LW editor is O.k. with me.

Me too.

&gt Then again: if I really really cared about this, I suppose I would

My "meta-complaint" about the LW editor is that it isn't as easy to
customize and fix as GNU Emacs is, even though you have the source
code.  For example, it seems to be very hard to customize indentation
apart from the very basic EDITOR:SETUP-INDENT function.  Imagine how
you'd do something like this

  http://boinkor.net/lisp/cl-indent-patches.el

in LispWorks...

I use C-h w and then type the name in the minibuffer, with tab

&gt Overall, do you guys customize the key bindings to be like SLIME or

Here's some stuff to make the IDE behave more like SLIME:

&gtBut the biggest issue that bugs me is this:
&gt
&gt   (keyboard-translate ?\050 ?\071) ; 9 -&gt (
&gt   (keyboard-translate ?\071 ?\050) ; ( -&gt 9
&gt   (keyboard-translate ?\051 ?\060) ; 0 -&gt )
&gt   (keyboard-translate ?\060 ?\051) ; ) -&gt 0
&gt
&gtmy hand is already injured and typing all the parenthesis is really
&gtpainful.

Maybe you should try the Dvorak layout (US) or 
some variant of it (and an ergonomic keyboard). I 
have designed a Dvorak like layout for the French 
language that I use on a ergonomic and 
programmable keyboard. Parens are well placed. See :
http://www.algo.be/ergo/dispositions.htm#kinesis

And finally, I have remapped many of the LW 
editor commands to make them easy to type with 
this layout using the technic described by John. For example:
(bind-key "Evaluate Defun" '#\control-\e)

Francis

&gtI know most people usually do this:
&gt
&gt   (keyboard-translate ?\( ?\[)
&gt   (keyboard-translate ?\[ ?\()
&gt   (keyboard-translate ?\) ?\])
&gt   (keyboard-translate ?\] ?\))
&gt
&gtIf anyone know if one can remap the keys in the LW IDE I'd love to
&gtknow!
&gt
&gt
&gtOf course, paredit is also very helpful in emacs so you don't have to
&gtbalance the parenthesis and save a lot of typing. But that might be
&gttoo much to ask :-)

This matches my (X)Emacs configuration, though the behavior differs
slightly with respect to `undo':

(editor:bind-key "Insert \()" #\[ :mode "Lisp")
(editor:bind-key "Insert \()" #\[ :mode "Execute")
(editor:bind-key "Move Over )" #\] :mode "Lisp")
(editor:bind-key "Move Over )" #\] :mode "Execute")
(editor:bind-string-to-key "[" #\meta-\[ :mode "Lisp")
(editor:bind-string-to-key "[" #\meta-\[ :mode "Execute")
(editor:bind-string-to-key "]" #\meta-\] :mode "Lisp")
(editor:bind-string-to-key "]" #\meta-\] :mode "Execute")
