                <h1>Major new product written in LispWorks</h1>
                <pre>
The release of InspireData(TM), a new educational data visualization  
product, was announced on July 5 at the 2006 National Educational  
Computing Conference.   It was a big hit, with extra presentations  
added by popular demand, and some blogs pronouncing it the highlight  
of the conference.

InspireData is implemented entirely in LispWorks Common Lisp using  
OpenGL.  It was written by Clozure Associates under contract with  
TERC.   Originally funded by NSF, it is being published by  
Inspiration Software, a leading educational software publisher with  
more than 15 million users.  With Inspiration Software's marketing  
prowess and market penetration, we are expecting InspireData to very  
quickly become the biggest-selling shrinkâ€“wrapped Lisp product ever.
