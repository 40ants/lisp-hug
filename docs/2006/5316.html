                <h1>LispWorks on Intel iMac</h1>
                <pre>
Hi,

Yesterday we received our Intel iMac (swapped for free by Apple under  
the DTK Exchange Program).

I installed LispWorks Personal Edition 4.4.6 for Macintosh on it.  
Installation worked just fine.

The LispWorks Application (which is of course non-native) started and  
came up after a (long) while.

And it seems that things work OK ! I ran the Othello example. So that  
is very good news.

The problem is that most operations, or the reaction to operations,  
often hangs for some time, up to the point that I thought the  
application hung. This occurs so often that LispWorks is almost  
unusable. I thought it had something to do with GC, but manually  
invoking GC through GC-IF-NEEDED or MARK-AND-SWEEP didn't cause the  
delays. There was also nothing in the logs (as far as I could see).  
Speed seemed to be good, as long as there was no spinning beachball  
involved.

It has been asked on this list before: what is LispWorks' strategy  
concering the Intel transition of Apple ? While the current PPC  
version be made usable on Intel (the easiest short term solution) or  
will there be a new Intel native version somewhere in the future (the  
best option for the future of course), or are there enough resources  
to do both ?

As a Mac user I am obviously very interested !

Thx,

Sven

I'd like to add to the wishlist: Make it possible to build universal
binaries from either version, or at least from the intel version!
(But if this wish doesn't come true, I guess it's relatively easy to
patch together universal .app's from two delivered binaries?)
