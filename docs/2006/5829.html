&gt &gt What is the relationship between the LW thread priorities, and the

&gt &gt Is there anything I should/can do to ensure the Lisp 
&gt threads are not 
&gt &gt preempted by the C++ threads?
&gt 
&gt LispWorks sets the Windows thread priority level according to 
&gt the value of MP:PROCESS-PRIORITY.
&gt 
&gt Below 0, it is set to THREAD_PRIORITY_LOWEST.
&gt 
&gt Between 0 and 500000, it is set to THREAD_PRIORITY_BELOW_NORMAL.
&gt 
&gt Above 500000, it is set to THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL.

Thank you, that explains it. All my Lisp threads (processes) were created with default priority, 0, which means they all had lower priority than my C++ threads. I just tried changing it, and now my Lisp threads are much faster. 


Is there any way of setting THREAD_PRIORITY_ABOVE_NORMAL (except using the FFI)?
