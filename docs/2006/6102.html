                <h1>win 32 system calls</h1>
                <pre>
This may seem like a stupid question, but, like in the good old days of V6/V7 
unix, I wish I had someone looking over my shoulder telling me how to use my 
tools better.

I need to do some Win32 calls, e.g. RegOpenKeyEx, and am about to specify and 
execute them using FLI (painful, since I'll have to dig through uSoft 
documentation).

One would think that most of these calls are already implemented in LWW, 
especially when one finds suggestive symbols like WIN32::REG-OPEN-KEY in a 
do-symbols listing.

I'm wondering if I'm missing something - if I'm not making sufficient use of 
all of the LWW (or CL) "toolset".

Should I be able to use the existing WIN32::REG-OPEN-KEY?  How do I find out 
more about it?  (The function browser tool gives only a tiny bit of info).

thanx for any hints

If you're interested in playing with the Windows registry in
particular, here's what I found out:

  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.lispworks.general/880

As you'll see from that message, this isn't documented by LispWorks
and you certainly won't get any warranties from me, so you're on your
own...

HTH,
Edi.
