                <h1>Expand/collapse callback in tree views?</h1>
                <pre>
Is there a callback that gets called whenever a node is expanded or
collapsed in a tree view?  I haven't found one but I'm notorious for
not seeing the forest for the trees... :)

I tried with an :AFTER method for TREE-VIEW-UPDATE-AN-ITEM, but I saw
the effects that I wanted "one step too late," so to say.  Is that
function called reliably whenever something is collapsed/expanded?
Maybe I was just missing an APPLY-IN-PANE-PROCESS or somesuch.

Thanks,
Edi.

How about :checkbox-change-callback initarg?

Maybe a :BEFORE method for TREE-VIEW-UPDATE-AN-ITEM?   (if
it is one step too late). Or subclass tree-view and write your own 
method for the previous.

I am a little fuzzy on what you really what.  Do you want full control 
over whether
something is expanded/collapsed, or just be informed of its status?
