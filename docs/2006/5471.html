                <h1>The Common Lisp Directory rewritten in Python</h1>
                <pre>
A short announcement: Some of you have might have already noticed the
use of URLs for the Common Lisp Directory that indicate that Python
code is used. It's indeed the case that we have switched from a
server application based on Common Lisp to one based on Python. The
reason is that we had some problems with regard to multithreading and
the HTML code generation utilities that we use. In order not to risk
any stability issues, we have quickly rewritten the whole application
logic in Python, and it seems that everything works well now. We will
give a fully detailed report of the problems of using Common Lisp in
web application development in a few days when the transition is
finished and fully tested.

Some of you might now think that this is a bad case of not eating our
own dog food, but it's simply better to be pragmatic here and use a
solution that actually works instead of spending time on fixing
complex interactions between incompatible libraries. Needless to say
that we stand fully committed behind Common Lisp and especially the
Common Lisp Directory, due to its popularity with users and its
recognition in major search engines (Google, etc.) in a very short
amount of time. For the time being, we will stick to Python for the
Common Lisp Directory, but will reevaluate the situation in the
coming months.
