Hello,

If I have a display-pane for which the initargs :horizontal-scroll,
:vertical-scroll, and :pane-can-scroll are all set to t, is there a
way to pragmatically retrieve the horizontal and vertical scroll-panes
associated with the display-pane?  I would like to make use of the
functions range-start, range-end, range-slug-start, and range-slug-end
to control the scroll bars, but I can't find the corresponding
scroll-panes.  Is the implementation such that there are no
capi:scroll-panes?  If so, how could I get the same functionality as
the functions above from, for instance,
set-vertical-scroll-parameters, etc?  Setting the slug-size and
slug-position doesn't seem to behave exactly like I would expect, so I
can't figure out how to equate the manipulation of these parameters to
range-slug-start/end.   Thanks very much

Andrew Shilliday

Hi again,  I asked this question a few weeks ago and haven't gotten
any responses.  I thought I would post it one more time.  Sorry for
the duplicate posts.
