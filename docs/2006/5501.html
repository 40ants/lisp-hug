                <pre>
Franz seemed to be getting a lot of attention (and business) with allegro cache. 

I'm not sure if it is appropriate for lispworks to state their stance in this
mailing list, but I was wondering if there is a plan to provide something
similar to it.

I know there's PLOB, but it seems that there are some licensing issues with the
c code it uses (http://plob.sourceforge.net/). Plus it's not as easy to use as
allegro cache.

For a lot of projects with large data set, allegro cache really shine. If anyone
feel the same and wish something similar available for lispworks, please speak
up here so Xanalys can seriously consider the possibility...

You might want to visit the ECLM where Arthur Lemmens will talk about
his new "Rucksack" library:

  &lt;http://weitz.de/eclm2006/&gt

Dave Fox and Martin Simmons from LispWorks will also be there.

And one seat is still available... :)

Cheers,
Edi.

Does not seem so with regard to the business. Their sales are  
agressive and I think it is because the business is not so good.  
Besides, at least ACL 7.0 is buggy, and they can't fix their bugs  
(Allegro support contacted me, got a bug report and then disappeared;  
and I have two more yielding SIGILL on insane code fragments running  
on all other implementations).

I believe that it is at least partly because AllegroCache is bundled  
with ACL and not a portable product; when I make decisions about  
technologies, I avoid lock-in as much as possible. So it is good news  
(Rucksack) that a possible alternative with LispWorks is not vendor- 
bound.

Apart from the fact that I'd personally prefer pure Lisp solutions for
various reasons, I think that Berkeley DB is a solution most
commercial projects will have problems with - you either have to
release your code under the GPL or you have to pay /lots/ of money.
Don't know if that'll change now that Oracle has bought them.

&gt Franz seemed to be getting a lot of attention (and business) with
&gt allegro cache.

As others say, I'm not sure how much real business they are getting
from Allegro Cache.  It's probably a good sales tool, though.

Having said that, Allegro Cache is cool and I think it is the sort of
problem that everyone solves uniquely for their particular project.  I
wish there was a popular solution that most people used that ran on
LispWorks and others.  For me, that would be more attractive than a
LispWorks only solution.

One more datapoint on what people do in the real world: Since we have
a slightly irrational dislike for RDBMS so we wrote a simple B+Tree
implementation in pure CL -- I think it only took a few days if I
remember right.  Berkeley DB is also an attractive solution that we
considered but it had those licensing issues.

Chris Dean

Actually I would like to see something where you could save the image
in a running mp LW image.  Right now you have to start up LW is non-mp
mode and save an image.  If there could be a facility for a dynamic
save image and continue then I could could see the ability to write
a simple LW DB Server for smaller apps that need centralized controlled
persistence.

The idea behind this is that a Lisp Image is a Database.  You can store
data is all sorts of forms,code(triggers) and meaning into it.

It may also be nice to create something analogous to sys:in-static-area
where persistent objects could be allocated and then split/joined into
a Lisp Image.

An interface like

persistence:in-persitent-storage
persistence:attach-persistent-store
persistence:detach-persistent-store

I'm in the second category - most of the time I ship custom-made apps
in very small numbers.  I negotiated with SleepyCat in the initial
phase of one project two years ago, but each of their offers was far
beyond what would have been a reasonable price for us.  AllegroCL
including AllegroCache is dirt-cheap compared to Berkeley DB.

&gt I'm kind of in the opposite camp to you I guess - though I'd like a

&gt rather not have to do.

I think this very much depends on what you're doing.  AllegroCache
itself is a good example because they initially used BerkeleyDB as a
backend, then switched to a Lisp-only solution, and found out that
they were faster that way.  If you know your data well, you'll most
likely be able to beat a general purpose B-tree implementation like
BerkeleyDB given enough effort.  (No, I haven't done this myself.)

That's the point. Some years ago, I have 
developped an application using Allegrostore 
(ancestor of AllegroCache, backend ObjectStore). 
Now that I have some experience with CLSQL and 
PostgreSQL, I'm sure it would have been very 
difficult to develop this application without a 
true OODB: many classes in the schema and 
permanently evolving schema while in production (weekly update during months).

I think a full Lisp solution is better because of 
the royalties and dependance problem (I remember 
a bug where Franz had to wait many months a fix from the ObjectStore company).

BTW, I like vendor-bound solutions because it usually means better support.

Francis

Well, I chose lispworks because I need to do commercial application
development, so something based on Berkeley DB would not work for me.
What we did is write a layer on top of CommonSQL, but I would have
preferred a "real" object DB for that part of the project.  I really
tried to use PLOB!, but could not get a license for POSTORE.

I agree with the initial poster that this would be a great selling
point for LW.  I don't know what this "rucksack" thing is about, but
I hope it uses something closer to LLGPL or BSD, so it's also
usable for commercial purposes.
