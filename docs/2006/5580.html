                <h1>Fastest way to turn 4 bytes into a 32 bit number?</h1>
                <pre>

I have 4 bytes, each 8 bits long.  I wish to turn these into a single
32 bit number.  What's the fastest way to do that in LispWorks on
Linux?

I tried a number of different approaches and looked at the disassemble
output and ran some micro benchmarks and the best I could come up with
is the PACK-4-BYTES-V0¨function below.  Is there a better way?

There are some other versions below for your entertainment.

Thanks for any tips you might have,
Chris Dean

Beware fixnum-safety 0 -- PACK-4-BYTES-V0 is only fastest because it doesn't
do all the work :-)  The intermediate ash results are not fixnums.

I suspect something like below might be the fastest, because it can safely
compute two 16 bit quuantities as fixnums.

(defun pack-4-bytes-v3 (b0 b1 b2 b3)
  (declare (optimize (speed 3) (debug 0) (space 0) (safety 0)
                     (compilation-speed 0))
           (type (unsigned-byte 8) b0 b1 b2 b3))
  (logior (the (unsigned-byte 32)
               (ash (logior (the (unsigned-byte 16) (ash b0 8)) b1) 16))
	  (logior (the (unsigned-byte 16) (ash b2 8)) b3)))

(defun pack-4-bytes-v4 (b0 b1 b2 b3)
  (declare (optimize (speed 3) (debug 0) (space 0) (safety 0)
                     (compilation-speed 0))
           (type (unsigned-byte 8) b0 b1 b2 b3))
  (dpb (logior (the (unsigned-byte 16) (ash b0 8)) b1) (byte 16 16)
       (logior (the (unsigned-byte 16) (ash b2 8)) b3)))

Good catch!  I eventually figured that out after a while :).

Great, thanks - I'll use a variant of the ones below.
