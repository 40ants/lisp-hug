Hello all,

Would it not be useful to split the mailing list in two parts, 
one for questions about Capi, another one for the rest?

Dave, would this too much to ask?

Francis

I think it's fine as it is.  Any reason why you would want that?

For me personally, that wouldn't be very useful.  I'm interested in
everything related to LispWorks, and I don't think we have an amount
of traffic that's unbearable.

I'm not interrested in the many messages about Capi now (I don't 
read them but keep them for possible future use).
2 lists would made email filtering into 2 separate email boxes reliable.
2 boxes would make searches into emails more efficient.

&gtSuggestion to Francis.  Use a mail program that handles user-created
&gtrules, e.g., takes lisp-hug messages and puts them in a folder, and
&gttakes messages containing "Capi" and puts them in a subfolder for
&gtreview or deletes them.

Thank you for the suggestion (the second one :-)
I already use Eudora and its powerful filtering system (I 
probably have about one hundred folders). But it's not enough.

&gtI empathize in that I'm not knowledgeable about or interested in Capi
&gt*at the moment*, but scanning a message for 1 second and pressing the
&gtdelete key isn't hard.

Every second is valuable.

Francis

&gtMore at issue is the distraction of getting
&gtany email when I'm concentrating, but for that I just turn the
&gtincoming-mail sound off.

&gt
&gtActually we briefly discussed the same idea internally at LispWorks a
&gtfew months back but we felt the number of messages was not high enough
&gtto require it.
&gt
&gtAs the other responses show there's not much call for splitting this
&gtlist at the moment, so I suggest we end this thread here. If and when
&gtvolumes get a lot higher, then it will be worth reconsidering, so
&gtthanks for the suggestion.

Thank you to all for your time,

Francis

No, I don't think it's a good idea yet. There are just  few posts
every day...
