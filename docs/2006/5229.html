&gt&gt Dear List,
&gt&gt
&gt&gt I am looking for a reliable XML parser that works well in
&gtLispWorks.
&gt&gt I have had considerable trouble with many of the so-called "open"
&gt&gt implementations, particularly the stuff from Franz, it boggles my
&gt&gt mind that "open" code can use so many proprietary extensions to the
&gt&gt language/libraries.
&gt&gt
&gt&gt Any suggestions would be appreciated.

&gtWell, you could use S-XML, http://common-lisp.net/project/s-xml
&gtIt is a small, simple, non-validating parser with both SAX and DOM  
&gtstyle interfaces.
&gtIt has been around for some years and is being used in a number of  
&gtother open-source projects.
&gtMany people contributed to it. Namespace support was recently added.
&gtIt is good enough for a large number of XML applications, but it  
&gtmight fall short for some more complicated tasks.
&gt
&gt&lt;/self-promotion&gt
