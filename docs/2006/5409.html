                <pre>
For a demo, I need to open a window and display a pdf (for example, using 
Acrobat), then draw rectangles over certain areas and capture/react-to mouse 
clicks and motion over that window.  What I think I want is a "transparent" 
window that I control, overlaid over Acrobat.

Can anybody think of a trick that will achieve this, or something similar?  
The demo has to run under Windows, so a Windows-specific solution would be 
acceptable.

Another option is to find a free pdf viewer that runs under Windows and to 
hack on it until it gives me what I want.  Anybody aware of such a free 
viewer?

Thanks

Sounds like you want Acrobat Forms.

Adobe Acrobat isn't just a viewer or converter. It is a development 
platform. You can turn PDF documents into GUIs coded in JavaScript.

Here is an old article:
