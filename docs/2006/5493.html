I'm running a delivered application that acts as a web server (using
Hunchentoot).  The application, currently being tested, is started
with nohup on a Linux machine.

Some days later, nohup.out contains lines the following (lot of them):

  Recursive error in coerce to condition.
    1 (continue) Try finding the class CONDITIONS::COERCE-TO-CONDITION-ERROR again
    2 (abort) Quit process.

  Type :b for backtrace, :c &lt;option number&gt to proceed,  or :? for other options

  CL-USER 1 : 1 &gt 
  ;; End-of-file in a listener, exiting one level.

  Recursive error in coerce to condition.
    1 (continue) Try finding the class CONDITIONS::COERCE-TO-CONDITION-ERROR again
    2 (abort) Quit process.

  Type :b for backtrace, :c &lt;option number&gt to proceed,  or :? for other options

  CL-USER 1 : 1 &gt 
  ;; End-of-file in a listener, exiting one level.

I'm very sure that everything happening in this application happens in
newly created processes.  I'm also pretty sure that all errors should
be caught by my code somehow.  Any idea why the app is thrown into a
listener?  And what could be the cause of this?  How am I supposed to
debug this?

Thanks,
Edi.

With "severity level" do you mean the delivery level?  Ah, that would
make sense.  You mean the tree shaker might have removed the condition
from the image?

Thanks,
Edi.
