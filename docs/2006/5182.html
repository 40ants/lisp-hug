Which OS are you running? I could be the OS, maybe its doing some system 
things.
My Windows PC clock regularly loses large amounts of time (a few seconds 
a day).

My intial reaction to your real-time needs (&lt; 10ms) is, yikes!

I do think however that LW does have a "real-time" GC floating around 
somewhere, though
I am not sure where I read that.

Thanks for your answer.

I run on Mac OS 10.4.
Excuse me, as you can see my English is very poor : what's mean  "yikes"
exactly? Is it the expression of a scepticism (witch I suspect...) ?

I was myself very sceptic about the possibility of doing real-time
scheduling in Lisp, but someone told me that, with native multi threads,
it's possible to make something very efficient. He told me about some
examples on OpenMcl. This is why I made these tests.

I'd say "yikes" is an expression of amazement, shock or fear. My  
French is poorer than your English, but I'd venture that "yikes" fits  
in somewhere between "sacre bleu" and "merde".

Japanese lisp legend Takeuchi claims that he has achieved mean wake up
times of lisp threads of 14 microseconds, with 119 microseconds as the
worst delay - on his vintage (1993) lisp machine!

&gtI was myself very sceptic about the possibility of doing real-time
&gtscheduling in Lisp,

According to the time constraint, it'is EVEN 
possible with standard CL implementations. I have 
done this about 10 years ago, using ACL on a Sun 
sparc, time limit less than 1 sec - (1/2 sec if I remember). Look at OPA here:
http://algo.be/ref-projects.htm

In the real-time sub-system, the global GC was 
disabled, after the loading of the knowledge 
bases. The application proved to be viable 
regarding the real time constraint (the main problem was KB validation).

Bien à vous,

Francis
