Hi,

the following code

---------------------------------------------
(defvar *threads-count* 20)
(defvar *row-count* 12000)
(defvar *template* "Z-test_output.~A")

(defun write-it-z(fname)
   (with-open-file (output fname :direction :output :if-does-not- 
exist :create :if-exists :supersede :element-type 'character)
     (dotimes (i *row-count*)
       (format output "~F ~F ~F ~F ~F ~F ~F ~F ~F ~F~%" 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  
8 9 10))))

(lw:set-default-character-element-type 'lw:simple-char)	

(mp:initialize-multiprocessing)
(defun do-it()
   (dotimes (i *threads-count*)
     (mp:process-run-function "test-function" '(:priority 3) #'write- 
it-z (format nil *template* i))))


(do-it)
-----------------------------------------------

creates files with varying output on all platforms under Lispworks  
4.4.6. Does it mean that FORMAT is not thread-safe? Is it intended to  
be not thread-safe? If it is not intended, how can it be worked around?

David

I've always assumed it not to be thread-safe, so my logging library
uses a lock, but I don't remember if I actually found that information
somewhere or just assumed it based on similar tests to yours.

Don't know if it's intended, but how about something like this?

  (defvar *format-lock* (mp:make-lock :name "format-lock"))

  (lw:defadvice (format thread-safe :around)
      (&amp;rest args)
    (mp:with-lock (*format-lock*)
      (apply #'lw:call-next-advice args)))

Or is that hammer too big?

Ouch! Sorry for not looking into this in detail the first time!

You're absolutely right. That seems like a huge bug to me. It could
perhaps explain some errors I get occasionally in PrimeTrader.

&gtI think so. FORMAT is called in the PostScript backend to output
&gtalmost every PostScript command, and that will decrease the performance.

I think it is a buffering problem.
Changes below seem to fix it for me on LWW4.4.6

(defun write-it-z(fname)
   (with-open-file (output fname :direction :output :if-does-not-exist 
:create :if-exists :supersede :element-type 'character)
     (dotimes (i *row-count*)
       (without-preemption
        (format output "~F ~F ~F ~F ~F ~F ~F ~F ~F ~F~%" 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)
        (stream:stream-flush-buffer output)))))

cheers

I think it's a bug in the ~f implementation.

But isn't that because of the without-preemption?

Here's a somewhat different piece of code exploring this possibility:

(defun tilde-f-tester ()
  (let ((f (format nil "~f" 1.0)))
    (unless (equal f "1.0")
      (format t "Ouch! f=~a!~%" f))))

(defun test-loop ()
  (loop for i below 10000 do (tilde-f-tester)))

(defun test-it ()
  (loop for i below 100 do
        (mp:process-run-function "tester" nil #'test-loop)))

Sample output (all tests done with 4.4.6 on debian linux so far):

[ev@merced:/tmp/tmp]$ Ouch! f=0!
Ouch! f=0!
Ouch! f=0!
Ouch! f=0!
Ouch! f=0!
Ouch! f=0!
Ouch! f=0!
Ouch! f=0!
Ouch! f=0!
Ouch! f=0!
Ouch! f=0!
Ouch! f=0!
Ouch! f=0!
Ouch! f=0!
Ouch! f=0!
Ouch! f=0!
Ouch! f=0!


(I'm now hoping for a quick LispWorks fix and praying to the great
 bitmaster in the skies that this bug can explain a significant
 fraction of the PrimeTrader bugs I see ;-))

I modified my code to write out a list of the character codes of the
wrongly formatted string, and that sure was interesting! It seems to
always be 3 characters long, and it always has 0 in the right place
and sometimes also 1, but the decimal point is replaced with a zero
char, and so is the 1 (most of the time):

Ouch! f=(0 0 48)!
Ouch! f=(49 0 48)!
Ouch! f=(0 0 48)!
Ouch! f=(0 0 48)!
Ouch! f=(0 0 48)!
Ouch! f=(0 0 48)!
Ouch! f=(0 0 48)!
Ouch! f=(0 0 48)!
Ouch! f=(0 0 48)!
Ouch! f=(0 0 48)!
Ouch! f=(0 0 48)!
Ouch! f=(49 0 48)!
Ouch! f=(0 0 48)!

This explains an exotic bug we got a few times at Netfonds (and worked
around), which we thought was due to the sql library, but which we now
see is due to ~a formatting (which also doesn't work, presumably
because the buggy code is somewhere deep down in the fp formatting
code) in multiple threads.

To the LispWorks guys: Do you want a bug report on this? It's probably
o.k. to wait for a fix in 5.0 if you manage that in time for the
release, otherwise I'd like a private patch for this issue, I'm pretty
sure it must hit both the PrimeTrader server and client every now and
then (they are both heavily multithreaded and use ~f formatting in a
lot of concurrent threads), so it's a quite severe bug for us (BTW:
thanks David for spotting this!).
