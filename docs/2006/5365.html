                <h1>MS Windows: Missing output in Shell window</h1>
                <pre>
This is a LWW / MS Windows question.

If I run a certain program from a Windows Command Prompt (DOS)
window I get certain output in the Command Prompt window,
but if I run the same program from a LispWorks Shell window
or using SYSTEM:CALL-SYSTEM-SHOWING-OUTPUT some of the output
is missing.

What could explain this?

I had a play with redirecting the error output to see if the
missing output was the same as the error output, but it wasn't.

Perhaps the program is not flushing its output properly on exit.
Could that explain it? (And if so, why the difference between
the two situations?)

&gt 
&gt Yes, that's possible, but it's a little strange.
&gt 
&gt What happens if you run it in a Cammand Prompt with the 
&gt output piped through MORE?

Hi Martin.

The result is the same as with a LispWorks Shell window -- I lose
the same output.


&gt Do you have GNU Emacs on Windows?  It would be interesting to 
&gt see if it works in an emacs shell buffer.

I do now :-) (version 21.3.1).

The same problem shows up.

I have some more info:

The developer of the program sent me a new version, where he
uses C++'s cout and cerr. Previously he was using printf and stdout.
That seems to have made the problem go away.

Does that make sense to you? Does it tie in with the knowledge
behind your comment "that's possible, but it's a little strange"?
