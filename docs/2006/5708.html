                <h1>most specific class instantiation</h1>
                <pre>
Hello all,

Be forewarned, this is not a Lispworks specific question. There are a
number of very
skilled people who read this list however, and I hope that someone
might be able to
help me with what I'm about to ask.

In using methods and classes which inherit from others, it's seems
easy to come up with
a hierarchy similar to the following.

Class virtual-A is a container which can contain items of type
Virtual-B. There are various actions that can happen to contents of a
virtual-A, and some of them might affect other contents
in the instance. For instance, inserting a virtual-b into a virtual-a
means that every item in the virtual-a needs to be frobbed.
That might wrriten

(defmethod insert ((a virtual-a) (b virtual-b))
   ...
   (dolist (item (contents a))
       (frob item))
   ...)

Now perhaps I make a concrete-a and concrete-b, which inherit from their virtual
counterparts. When a concrete-b is inserted into a concrete-a, the
frobbing still
needs to happen, but there is no additional action necessary. The same insert
method used above will work.

Now, suppose I have an import procedure which takes an A (either
virtual or concrete)
and a  list of items from which B's (virtual or concrete) can be
construcred and constructs
the objects and inserts them. It seems wasteful to have two, almost
identical methods:

(defmethod import ((a virtual-a) l)
    (dolist (item l)
        (insert a (make-instance 'virtual-b :item item))))

(defmethod import ((a concrete-a) l)
   (dolist (item l)
       (insert a (make-instance 'virtual-b :item item))))

One approach would be to not use make-instance, but rather some sort of
make-corresponding-b, so as to write:

(defmethod import ((a virtual-a) l)
   (dolist (item l)
       (insert a (make-corresponding-b a :item item))))

where the idea is that make-corresponding-b would be overridden to
make whatever type of
B was suited to whatever type of A was provided. That seems somewhat
hackish to me
though.

The issue seems to be that methods are usually written for the most
general case, so as to
keep special cases in the special methods where they belong. However,
what I'm looking for
here is some way to get the most specific type possible, but in a general way.

I'm going to continue researching into this sort of thing, but if
anyone knows of any approach
to this problem, or an alternative, or could just tell me why this is
a *wrong* way to do something,
I'm all ears and would be greatly appreciative!

Thanks!

&gt &gt (defmethod import ((a concrete-a) l)
&gt &gt   (dolist (item l)
&gt &gt       (insert a (make-instance 'virtual-b :item item))))
&gt
&gt As far as I can see these method bodies are identical and you only
&gt need the first one.

Yes, that's exactly what I meant. I made a typo.

&gt
&gt Assuming you meant the second one to do (make-instance 'concrete-b ...)
&gt I'd say refactor.
&gt
&gt &gt One approach would be to not use make-instance, but rather some sort of
&gt &gt make-corresponding-b, so as to write:
&gt &gt
&gt &gt (defmethod import ((a virtual-a) l)

&gt &gt though.
&gt
&gt This is something of a refactoring. Personally I'd go for
&gt
&gt (insert a (make-instance (correct-insertion-type-of a) :item item))
&gt
&gt where correct-insertion-type-of is either a method or a slot of class
&gt allocation type.
&gt
&gt &gt The issue seems to be that methods are usually written for the most
&gt &gt general case, so as to
&gt &gt keep special cases in the special methods where they belong. However,
&gt &gt what I'm looking for

&gt &gt anyone knows of any approach
&gt &gt to this problem, or an alternative, or could just tell me why this is
&gt &gt a *wrong* way to do something,
&gt &gt I'm all ears and would be greatly appreciative!
&gt
&gt Perhaps you could give us a more concrete example (no pun intended)
&gt because I have a problem picturing the situation in real code.

Without going into too much detail, the issue can come up when there
are parallel
class hierarchies.. E.g. (from http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1621)

"
class Doc {
	void register(View view) { ... }
	void notify(Notification n) { ... }
}

abstract class View {
	abstract void paint(Doc doc);
	abstract void update(Notification n);
}

class MyDoc extends Doc {
	void register(View view) {
		if (!(view instanceof MyView)) throw new IllegalViewError(...);
		super.register(view);
	}
}

class MyView extends View {
	void paint(Doc _doc) {
		MyDoc doc = (MyDoc)_doc;
		... // paint with 'doc'
	}

	void update(Notification n) {
		...
	}
}
"

But my issue arises from the fact that with LISP methods, I  don't
have to merely specify
an interface and then implement it. If some part, in this example, of
register and notify are
common to all Doc and View instances, there's no reason not to put
that in one method, and
then have more specific methods doing the more specific things plus a
call-next-method.

In that register:
	void register(View view) {
		if (!(view instanceof MyView)) throw new IllegalViewError(...);
		super.register(view);
	}

there's an error thrown for the view not being an instance of MyView.
Let's say I wanted
one more function in the Doc class, implemented at the more general
level, that made a call
to register. That method at the general level would have to ensure
that it passed a particular
sort of view to register, depending on what the most *specific* type
of the Doc was.

One way to do that is, as was shown above, something like

&gt (insert a (make-instance (correct-insertion-type-of a) :item item))

and that is what I am using at the moment. However, it does seem a
little awkward an
inelegant. I'm just wondering if there are theoretic or pragmatic
approaches that I'm not
aware of that address this, or if I'm working in a flawed object hierarchy.

Thanks!

Hi,

This is an instance of the "make isn't generic" problem - see http:// 
www2.parc.com/csl/groups/sda/publications/papers/Kiczales-ISOTAS93/

(With "make" they mean something like "make-instance" here.)

Your approach is probably good enough for your concrete problem at  
hand. It appears to be inelegant because this is actually a case of a  
hidden dependency on control flow. This becomes clearer when the code  
is broken down into smaller parts:

(defmethod import ((a virtual-a) l)
   (dolist (item l)
     (insert a (create-b item))))

(defun create-b (item) ...)

In this version, create-b cannot decide anymore which kind of b to  
instantiate. To be able to do this, a has to be passed as another  
parameter:

(defmethod import ((a virtual-a) l)
   (dolist (item l)
     (insert a (create-b a item))))

(defun create-b (a item)
   (make-corresponding-b a :item item))

Whenever a parameter has to be passed around down a call chain,  
without changing it, we are actually simulating dynamic scoping:

(defvar *a*) ; now a special variable

(defmethod import ((*a* virtual-a) l)
   (dolist (item l)
     (insert *a* (create-b item))))

(defun create-b (item)
   (make-corresponding-b *a* :item item))

This is the reason why the paper above essentially turns make- 
instance / make into something similar to a dynamically scoped  
function, because this allows changing its behavior based on the  
control flow.

In a Java setting, you could use AspectJ and define a cflow-style  
pointcut to modify invocations of "new". In Common Lisp, you could  
use ContextL and put all behavior related to virtual types in one  
layer and all behavior related to concrete types in another, and then  
use dynamically scoped activation/deactivation of layers to control  
instance creation. (You would have to use a replacement for make- 
instance that is defined as a layered function to make this work.)

Note that the code above (with the special variable *a*) is only for  
illustration - I am not arguing that this is good programming  
style. ;) AspectJ or ContextL would work, but are probably overkill  
for your specific case.
