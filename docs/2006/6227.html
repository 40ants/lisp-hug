                <h1>LW 4.3 CAPI on Linux, selection callback vs action callback</h1>
                <pre>

Hi,

I have a CAPI application that uses a list-panel to display a number of
entries.  The :selection-callback works as desired.  I also need a
callback that is invoked when the user hits "return" on an item.  The
:action-callback does this but as far as I can tell there is no way to
find out the index of the list-panel's cursor in the list of items.

It seems that the user can move the cursor without affecting the
selected item, so that isn't the index I need to capture the highlit
record when then user hits return.

Thanks for any help,

Greg

 &gt This doesn't happen for me with Open Motif (it changes the selected item when
 &gt I hit return).  Are you using Lesstif?

Open Motif 2.3.3, as installed from Fedora Core 3

In the list-panel, it is possible to move the cursor separately from the
selection, in which case the cursor appears as a dashed outline rather
than the solid highlit cursor bar- I take it that the related state is
unavailable to CAPI?

I'll do some more testing and try to express the behavior more clearly.

Thanks,

Greg
