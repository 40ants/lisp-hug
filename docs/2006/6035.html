I think what I miss most is DIRED. I usually *live* in DIRED...

&gt I think that's a big mistake.  I'm mentioning this because I had the

&gt or two years of fiddling about, I switched over to the LispWorks IDE

I wholeheartedly agree. I guess the only thing with the editor that
/really/ irritates me, is that control-X 2 doesn't do what I want
it to do. Two or more buffers in the same window can be really useful
from time to time...

I've used the IDE all the time, but I grew up with several emacs-
flavoured editors from the beginning (my first emacsen were FINE and
AMIS on tops-10, followed by the original TECO-based emacs on tops-20,
not much later I started using FRED on MACL 1.&lt;something&gt :-)), so I
guess I'm just used to the fact that emacs-style editing doesn't have
to be done in the One True Emacs.

&gt I still use GNU Emacs for almost everything else

Me too, e.g. I also use PCL-CVS in GNU Emacs for version handling, and
the fact that I can't do this inside the LW editor is O.k. with me.
