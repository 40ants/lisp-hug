                <h1>Printing in delivered application, LW 4.3.7 on Linux</h1>
                <pre>

I have a capi app that prints postscript output.  It runs &amp; prints fine
in the Lispworks environment but when I run the delivered image I get
the following runtime error when I attempt to print;

Error: REQUIRE called in delivery time with module capi-ps-lib
  1 (abort) Return to event loop.

Type :b for backtrace, :c &lt;option number&gt to proceed,  or :? for other
options


I've tried delivery level 0 and 4, same problem in each.  I've been
through the delivery user's guide without results so far.

Lacking capi-related source that presumably contains the offending
require, I'm unsure how to proceed further, so would appreciate any
hints.

I know 4.3 is pretty old at this point, I will be upgrading next time we
get some money in the budget...

Thanks,

Greg

I think you need to get the required module in your Lisp image before delivery.
Try adding a top-level (require "capi-ps-lib") to your delivery script 
before calling dv:deliver.
BTW the string argument to require is case sensitive.

Ah, perfect- working now, many thanks!
