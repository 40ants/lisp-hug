                <pre>
The Common Lisp Directory release 2 is here: http://www.cl-user.net
It's powered by LWL 4.4.6 on a Debian server.

The major improvements are:
  -The search facility (based on cl-ppcre).
  -A much more compact user interface.
  -Added the commented items to the RSS feeds
  -The tag filter works for anonymous users too now

At that time, there are already 551 registered users and 450 items on the CLD.
  -87 Documents/Web sites
  -22 Implementations
  -197 Libraries/tools/software
  -12 Groups/Organizations
  -124 People

As usual, everybody is invited to submit new items. Now with the search it's easier to
check if some library or document is already there to avoid duplicates.

The search was not working for anonymous users. It should be OK now.
