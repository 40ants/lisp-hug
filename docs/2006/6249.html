                <h1>bug in 5.0.1 (LWM 32bit intel)?</h1>
                <pre>
is it just me, or is there a bug introduced by 5.0.1 in Save (for a  
new file) and Save As... for any file, new or existing? Basically  
Save drops an Open sheet instead of a Save sheet and causes existing  
files to be overwritten!

Using LWM 5.0.1 32 bit intel. If I create a new file, then try to  
save it either with the keyboard shortcut or via the File:Save menu,  
I am presented with an *open* sheet, not a save sheet - i.e., there  
is no place to type in the name of the file, there is an Open button,  
there is a Searchlight search cartouche, etc., but no text field to  
enter the name of the file to be saved.

If I select an existing file in this open sheet and click the "Open"  
button, I am prompted that I am about to overwrite an existing file.  
If I click OK then the existing file is overwritten.

If I quit LWM with unsaved files, I am presented with a correct save  
*dialog* - i.e., *not* a sheet. this is the only way I can save new  
files!

I've rebooted my system just to be sure I wasn't running into any  
cocoa wierdness. It seems like Save and Save As... are now tied to  
code that drops an *open* file sheet, not a *save* file sheet as it  
should.

Yes, the same thing happens on PowerPC 32bit.

One work-around is to use the "Save File" editor command and type the  
path name.

It appears to be an issue just with the LW editor. My CAPI editor  
applications seem to be working OK.
