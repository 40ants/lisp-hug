I didn't look at the code, but if you post a more specific error
message from the LispWorks compiler I can try and walk you through it.

Something like "when compiling file X, I got compiler error E" would
be helpful.

Cheers,

I downloaded the file you linked to, and I got no errors in
compiling and loading it. (I opened the file in an editor,
selected file-&gtcompile and load.) The error you're getting,
though, is about end of file while reading stream. Have
you edited the file at all since you downloaded it? I'd
suggest re-downloading it and trying to compile again.
