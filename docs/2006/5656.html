                <pre>
Hello,

How to place a string into the MS Windows clipboard?
I have found (capi:set-clipboard pane value)
However I'm looking for something that doesn't rely on CAPI.

Thanks,

Francis

You will have to fight with the FLI then:

Why don't you want to use CAPI?  SET-CLIPBOARD looks like a nice
function.

Cheers,
Edi.

Thank you even I was afraid for such an advice. I'm looking for 1 minute solution...

I'm using Java SWT only for GUI.

BTW, it is strange that a function that "Sets the 
contents of the system clipboard" depends on CAPI.

Have you actually read the article I linked to?  The Win32 clipboard
operations are part of the Win32 GUI, the clipboard is owned by a
window, windows place information on the clipboard, and so on.  A
program without a GUI that manipulates the clipboard doesn't make
sense.  It makes perfect sense that this function is part of CAPI.

Why don't you set the clipboard with Java?

Maybe. On ACL, a similar function just needs a 
lisp object and a format description as arguments.
I vote for this solution.

I could do it but not in 1 minute.

IIUC, in AllegroCL, the clipboard functions are part of the Common
Graphics package and need a displayed window the Lisp image knows
about as well, it's just that you don't have to mention the window
explicitely.  Try to set the contents of the Windows clipboard from an
AllegroCL console image without Common Graphics.  I'd be surprised if
Franz knew ways to outsmart the operating system Lispworks doesn't
know.

You must be right (but will not check it :-)

BTW here is the SWT version (needs the import of 2 SWT classes):

(defun copy-to-clipboard (string)
   (let ((clipboard (clipboard.new *display*))
         (textTransfer (texttransfer.getinstance)))
     (clipboard.setcontents clipboard
                            (make-j-vector (list string))
                            (make-j-vector (list textTransfer) :type texttransfer.))
     (clipboard.dispose clipboard)))

Thanks for your time,

Francis
