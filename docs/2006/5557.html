                <h1>memory</h1>
                <pre>
Hi,

Mac OS X 4.6, 512 MB DDR SDRAM.

I implemented a pinboard-layout with a width of 20000 and a height of  
20000. LW crashed several times (with messages of the Mac OS or not).  
When I reduced the width to 4000 and the height to 5000 everything  
was o.k. (Crash: either there was the spinning ball and I had to quit  
from LW with help of the OS or LW crashed and the OS told me so).

I think it's a memory problem and naturally it's my fault. What  
interests me is the fact that I didn't get a warning from LW. Is this  
normal behavior (according to the implementation plans of the LW  
makers) or is it unusual (perhaps due to MacOS 4.6)?

Thanks in advance

Max

If you start LW from a shell you might see a bunch of messages  
printed there that will help you work out what is going on (or that  
you can report to Lispworks -- I've reported a bunch of problems on  
OS/X).

Cheers,
Bob
