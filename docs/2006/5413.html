                <h1>Really odd problem in a :children-function</h1>
                <pre>
Hello all,
I'm trying to use a graph-pane to display the results of some
tree code that's really more of a demonstration than anything else.
The problem I'm running into is really odd though.

Inside of a (make-instance 'capi:graph-pane ...) I have the following:

    :children-function #'(lambda (i)
                           (unless (isLeaf? i)
                             (let* ((l (kdtreenode-left  i))
                                    (r (kdtreenode-right i))
                                    (c (cond
                                        ((and l r) (print "case 1")(list r l))
                                        (l         (print "case 2")(list l))
                                        (r         (print "case 3")(list r))
                                        (t         (print "case 4")()))))
                               (prog1 c
                                 (unless (every #'identity c)
                                   (format t "~&amp;c is ~A~%" c))))))

A good portion of that code I've added trying to track down this
bug. The problem I get is that c ends up being, at one point,
a list of nil and and good value, i.e.
(nil #s(kdtreenode ...))

My output buffer does indeed have

"case 1"
"case 1"
"case 1"
"case 1"
"case 1"
"case 1"
c is (Nil #S(Kdtreenode ...))

which indicates to me that something strange is going on inside of that
cond. I really hope I've just been staring at this for too long, and that i'm
missing some very obvious that I would normally see. Unforunately, I can't
seem to reproduce it outside of the code I've got (which I can provide if
anyone would like to try).

Any thoughts?

That Nil in your output looks odd. My guess is that it is not CL:NIL.
Could it be the string "Nil"?

To see if this or something similar is the case, try changing the ~A
to ~S in the format string.
