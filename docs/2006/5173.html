                <h1>Highlighting in the editor pane</h1>
                <pre>
Hello 

I've spent a few hours wandering through the Lispworks documentation
but can't seem to find the simple example I'm looking for, maybe it
exists and I've missed it or maybe it's not simple ... Basically I
want to include an editor pane in an application which will colour any
url's (and some other text patterns) in the text and make them
clickable. This seems well within the capabilities of the control but
I don't see that there is a simple way of defining something such as
"Make all text strings matching regexp blue". Can someone point me to
an example or even just the right page if I've missed it?

    thanks

        Andrew

This should answer half of your question:

  &lt;http://article.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.lispworks.general/2290&gt

You know that the editor source code comes with the LW distribution?
There you should hopefully find enough info for the other half.

Cheers,
Edi.

Take a look at fontlock.lisp in the editor source. This shows how  
Lisp syntax coloring is done and also how to setup your own coloring  
function for a buffer.
