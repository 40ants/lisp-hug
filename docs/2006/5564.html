                <pre>
Hello,

If I write a "µ" character in a buffer and try to save it I get this error (LWw):

Error: In a call to seq::%set-access-array: #\µ is not of type base-char.
   1 (continue) Abort editor command.
   2 (abort) Return to event loop.


My Editor File encoding preferences are both Latin-1.

Thanks,
Francis

What does (char-code #\µ) return for you in the listener? Even though  
this is a valid Latin-1 character (code 181), I'm wondering if  
something about your settings is inserting the unicode version of  
this character. If Latin-1 is not a specific requirement, you could  
set your external format to UTF-8.

You are right:

USER 3 &gt (char-code #\µ)    ; your
181

USER 4 &gt (char-code #\µ)    ; mine
956

USER 5 &gt (type-of #\µ)      ; your
base-char

USER 6 &gt (type-of #\µ)
simple-char


I should check my Dvorak-fr keyboard driver!

&gtset your external format to UTF-8.

The Editor tool's Preferences dialog doesn't 
offer UTF-8 (LWw). Maybe this not supported in LW for Windows ?

Thank you for your help,

Francis

&gt
&gtYes, I see now that the option is not in the popup menu on the Mac
&gteither. But I believe both Mac and Windows support UTF-8 and UTF-16.
&gtLispWorks refers to UTF-16 as "Unicode". Check out the value of
&gt*EXTERNAL-FORMATS* in the listener for a full list.

(... :utf-8 ... :unicode ... :latin-1)


&gtIn the editor you can execute the "Set External Format" command to
&gtchange the current buffer to UTF-8. To have your file always use this
&gtinstead of the default setting, you can add a mode line to the top of
&gtthe file:
&gt
&gt; -*- mode: Lisp; encoding: utf-8; -*-

This doesn't work (according to the editor mode line).

The "Set External Format" command works: I can insert the unicode version
of the micro sign (char-code 956) and save the buffer.

&gtI'm sure there is a way to make UTF-8 the default by putting
&gtsomething in your init file, but it escapes me at the moment. If you
&gtcan't find it, let me know and I'll dig further.

I have tried:
(setf (editor:variable-value "Output Format Default") '(:utf-8 :eol-style :lf))
(setf (editor:variable-value "Input Format Default") '(:utf-8 :eol-style :lf))

To make the change permanent, it had to:
- first eval these 2 forms
- save from the editor preference dialog
(putting the forms in the init file has no effect).

However, after restarting LW, I get this error when I try to open *any* lisp file :
  Error reading file g:\pe\bugs.lisp: Undefined external format nil.

A bug in the editor maybe?

Francis

&gtStrange. It works for me on both Mac and Windows (LW 4.6.6).

I have checked it again, it doesn't work on my PC. LW 4.4.6 too :-) , Windows XP



&gt&gtI have tried:
&gt&gt(setf (editor:variable-value "Output Format Default") '(:utf-8 :eol- style :lf))
&gt&gt(setf (editor:variable-value "Input Format Default") '(:utf-8 :eol- style :lf))
&gt
&gtI have it like this (but I'm not loading it from an init file):
&gt
&gt(setf (editor:variable-value "Output Format Default" :global nil)
&gt'(:utf-8 :eol-style :lf))
&gt(setf (editor:variable-value "Input Format Default" :global nil)
&gt'(:utf-8 :eol-style :lf))

It doesn't make any difference. Idem with :global T.

Thanks,

Francis

&gt&gtThis doesn't work (according to the editor mode line).
&gtI am certainly no expert on this but I had the same problems when I switched from
&gtLatin-1 to UTF-8. I had in the file characters 
&gtthat are above ASCII-7, scandinavian letters.
&gt...
&gt
&gt&gtHowever, after restarting LW, I get this error when I try to open *any* lisp file :
&gt&gt  Error reading file g:\pe\bugs.lisp: Undefined external format nil.
&gt&gt
&gt&gtA bug in the editor maybe?
&gtI had the same error if I remember correctly. What i did was:
&gt
&gtI opened the file with Emacs (NT-emacs not the Lispworks-version.).
&gtThen I added the mode-line.
&gtThen I changed the coding system to utf-8 and saved the file
&gt(set-buffer-file-coding-system).
&gtAfter that everything works with LW-editor too.
&gt
&gtThe error perhaps was caused because the upper-Ascii-letters were not valid
&gtUTF-8 letters when the file was read back as UTF-8 coded.

All this looks too weird to me.
I'll wait the next release of LW and try again at that time.

Thank you for your time,

Francis
