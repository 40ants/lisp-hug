                <h1>Large file support ?</h1>
                <pre>

Is there a way in LispWorks to read and write large files that are
greater than 4GB ?  I've looked around for some official document that
describes OS and File System limits, but was unsuccessful.

Thanks!

(I've asked a variant of this question before in case you're feeling a
sense of deja vu.)

Ah ok.  Thanks for the information.
