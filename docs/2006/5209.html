Dear List,

I am a recent convert to Lisp and having been doing some work that
requires access to SMTP and POP3 from within Lisp. I have found a
nice library but it makes extensive use of a macro for if, called
if*, which I believe is part of ANSI Lisp. My macro skills are not up
to writing this macro myself since it seems quite weird as it has
placeholders all over the place which I do not know how to code in a
macro for example

(if* (some-condition) then (then-clause) elseif (elseif-clause) else
(else-clause)
                                 ^^^^                      ^^^^      
^^^^
does anyone know where I might find a definition of this macro ?

Thanks in advance

Vincent

See:

http://www.franz.com/~jkf/coding_standards.html

For if* source:

For if* documentation:

excl/if_s.htm

If you should have any trouble getting the smtp code to work in LW,  
just ask me, we have been using it succesfully for a long time.

Sven

Hi Vincent,

the original macro is present as far as I remember on John Foderaro's 
web site at www.franz.com, but I can't find the exact URL now. There is 
also an implementation of that macro (possible, that it is even the 
original one) at 
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/portableaserve/portableaserve/acl-compat/acl-excl-common.lisp?rev=1.7&amp;view=markup

Regards
Plamen
