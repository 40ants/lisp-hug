                <h1>Profiling a multiprocessing server?</h1>
                <pre>

We have an portableaserve based server that I would like to profile
and I'm not sure how to do that.  The server side function performs a
calculation and returns in less that one second.  It is that function
that we wish to profile.

What we would like to do is to turn let the server run for a few
minutes and collect profiling information on that function and
everything else in the package.  

Is there a way to turn on profiling, let the system run, and then
print out the profiling information using hcl:print-profile-list ?

I've tried the simple thing of just wrapping my server side function
in hcl:profile (so hcl:profile is called hundreds of times) but I
don't think that is working -- after a running for a few minutes
hcl:print-profile-list sometimes reports:

    No profiler data collected - may need to increase the length of the
    run.

Thanks again folks!

Regards,
Chris Dean

Cl-http has had this built in for years.  Works on the Lisp Machine  
and probably LW.

You might have a look and see how it works.

I have a similar issue in that I'd like to profile the activity on a
Lispworks ORB Corba server.  I've written my own profiling infrastructure,
which is nice in many ways, but it would be good to get fine-grained
sampled profiling data from Lispworks too (i.e. the usually function
stack information from the profiling tool), and I can't figure out how.

Yes, that's the same issue I'm having.

That's exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm interested in measuring a
fine grain profile of my code that is called in the response
function.  I don't know if LispWorks can do that.

Works perfectly - thanks!
