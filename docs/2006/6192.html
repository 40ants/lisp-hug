                <pre>
Hi,
I'm planning to deliver an application which will keep the
data next to where the application is located so people
can put the application and the data on a thumbdrive.

I guess I can't use *load-truename* (But I admit I didn't try.)
So how do I find where the application is located at run-time?

If you don't explicitly change the working directory, then I think 

(current-pathname)

might do the trick.

Under Windows it's not unusual to have an app start with the working 
directory set elsewhere.

It used to be that under Windows the first element of the command line was 
the executable, including its full path. I think that still works, but if 
it doesn't this is the official solution:

        
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dllproc/base/getprocessimagefilename.asp

This will work with both EXEs and DLLs:

        
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dllproc/base/getmodulefilename.asp

(EXEs are also modules.)

Of course, it's possible that LispWorks already has such functions. I'm 
just talking about what I remember from the old days. :-)

I think (lw::lisp-image-name) should do the trick.
