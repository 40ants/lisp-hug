I haven't toyed with it yet, but

http://foil.sourceforge.net/

seems extremely promising in that department.

As far as I understand how it works, they set-up
a Java server process you connect to from Lisp
using sockets. Once on the server, your requests
have access to 100% of the java stuff, be it Swing
or otherwise.

Part 1 should be painless, part 2 less so, I think.

I played around with JFLI

  &lt;http://jfli.sourceforge.net/&gt

some time ago and found it to be pretty easy to set up - it just
worked.  (It probably helps that JFLI was developed on LispWorks.)

Although JFLI seems to be working and complete the focus of the
developers has shifted towards FOIL which is supposed to replace JFLI:

  &lt;http://foil.sourceforge.net/&gt

I haven't used this one but as an example here's Francis Leboutte's
"Dialogue" which deploys FOIL to create SWT dialogs:

  &lt;http://www.algo.be/cl/dialogue/&gt

I haven't done any GUI programming with Java/Lisp.  I think the main
pain will be to figure out how to do the stuff in Java because even
though you're in a Lisp IDE you effectively let Java do the grunt work
and there's no CAPI-like layer atop it.  (Unless the Java GUI is
already there and you just want to call back and forth between it and
Lisp.  That might be easy and fun if you're lucky.)

HTH,
Edi.

I am the author of jFli and Foil. Both are viable, and Foil  
represents less a replacement for jFli than a different set of  
tradeoffs.

jFli runs a JVM in-proc and accesses it via JNI. It is a fast and  
easy way to do #1. However, being in-proc presents several  
challenges, especially for GUIs. Thus, Foil, which runs the JVM in a  
separate proc and communicates with it via sockets. This makes it  
easier to do #2, and multi-threaded programming in general, although  
some knowledge of Java is required if you want to create a custom JVM  
'host' with particular threading/socket characteristics. There are  
samples doing GUI with SWT - see the screenshots.

Both jFli and Foil offer similar, but not identical, high-level  
wrappers for Java classes/methods etc, transparent conversions and  
memory management. Both were authored in LispWorks, and are open  
source - feel free to fix/enhance...

I'll let some non-author speak to the relative 'pain' of using jFli  
or Foil.

For me, under LWL 4.3.7, using Jfli caused segmentation violations as the
image size grew. I never could pin down the exact size problems would begin.
Perhaps they began during a gc, for example. My final image was around 50Mb,
unoptimized and unshaken, but the problems began before I reached that size. 

I finally had to abandon Jfli. I wrote an out-of-process socket-based
interface between Java and Lisp, using Java reflection to generate stubs in
Lisp, creating Java object instances and returning their handles to Lisp,
calling methods via RPC calls using the handles, and "freeing" references to
those instances when they are no longer needed. As I was finishing that
software, Rich released Foil ... go figure :)

I never tested Jfli under LWW with the same image size so I don't know if the
same problems happen there. If I needed the same functionality again today,
I'd start by looking at Foil.

At some moment, my image (Foil/SWT app) suddenly grews from 30 Mb 
to about 60 Mb. I filtered some of the uneeded classes in the 
Java packages I use and the size went back to a more decent 30Mb 
(still completely unoptimized).

I'have been using Foil for a few months to make Java GUIs with SWT (and LWw). See:
http://www.eclipse.org/swt/
http://www.algo.be/cl/dialogue/index.htm
http://www.algo.be/ref-projects.htm#kmed

In this area I have some experience with CG (Common Graphics, 
ACL) and CLIM. I have found programming Foil/SWT quite similar to 
CG, SWT is a nice and mature package, still light comparing to 
Swing (maybe someone here has experience with both CAPI and CG 
and can tell how they compare in programming style).

Comparing to CG (2002), SWT has more features, for example I have 
found SashForm widget to be easy and convenient (an SashForm has 
draggable splitters, to divide a pane). For example, there are 4 
four nested SashForm widgets in this GUI (KMed application).
http://algo.be/cl/labage/KMed/images/working-with-situations.jpg
Adding 3 more SashForms into the main existing one and made them 
dynamic was a snap (its an optional view the user can choose).

I didn't use CAPI to develop KMed because KMed is peripheral to 
an application where a requirement was a solid grapher library 
(JGo, http://www.nwoods.com/go/jgo.htm )

On the downside:

Of course Foil/SWT is more difficult to install and start to work 
with than to use CAPI. You have to start the JVM, the Java Foil 
server, the Lisp Foil VM and extract the API from Java packages. However:
o Once done, forget it.
o I'm biased because I did not have any Java programming 
experience. BTW, my Java competence is still superficial, that's 
maybe a good point, you don't have to be a Java hacker to use Foil and SWT.

My main complain is about debugging and maybe robustness. I have 
found the debugger almost useless in the context of Foil/SWT 
programming. The condition displayed is often unrelated to the 
real error. I don't spend time anymore in looking at the 
backtrace. I'm becoming a champion of the trace utility and the 
print statement! Finally, I have found a "mode de vie" thanks to 
a with-error macro which I tend to use everywhere: it handles 
errors, displays a dialog showing the condition and allows me to 
continue to test the GUI without having to restart everything (JVM, etc.)

Finally, I think I can say Foil and SWT are a viable alternative 
to other solutions. I start to have encouraging feedback from 
KMed users (2 beta testers in fact). My productivity at GUI 
development is not that different from the one I had when I was 
programming with CG, even if some enhancements in Foil should improve it.

Francis
