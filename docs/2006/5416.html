                <h1>Save an image with the IDE</h1>
                <pre>

How do I save an image that still retains the LispWorks IDE/GUI ?  

(I think this is a FAQ and one I might even have asked before, but I
was unable to find the answer).

My normal pattern is to save a console only image and use SLIME for
development.  This works great and I can preload some packages in the
image to make my life easier.

Now, I would like to create an image that when it starts opens the
LispWorks IDE with all the normal menus, windows, etc.  How do I do
that?  Can someone point me to a good example?

I'm running on Linux and Mac OS.

Thanks!

Regards,
Chris Dean

Hi,

The example below is from the Lispworks Reference Manual entry for 
save-image. The only change is that I added ':environment t' to ensure that 
the IDE is launched when the saved image is started.

---8&lt;---
Here is an example initialization script. Save this to a file such as 
my-file.lisp , then run LispWorks with the command line argument -init 
c:/my-file.lisp to build the image my-image.exe .

(load-all-patches)

(load "my-application")

(save-image "my-image" :environment t)

(quit)
---8&lt;---

cheers

Thanks!  I tried that and it doesn't work on my Mac.  What it does is
create an image that when launched has a listener window, but no
menubar or anything else.  I can even load the Mac specific
macos-application-bundle.lisp and that doesn't help.

Below is my deliver script.

(load-all-patches)

#+:cocoa 
(compile-file-if-needed 
 (sys:example-file "/Applications/LispWorks 4.4.5/Library/lib/4-4-0-0/examples/configuration/macos-application-bundle.lisp")
 :load t) 

(save-image "my-image" :environment t)

Ah.

What happens if you do (env:start-environment) in the listener that you get ?
If this works maybe you could specify this as the :restart-function.

Maybe it is related to multiprocessing - you could try adding 
:multiprocessing t to your save-image.

(Just a couple of guesses - I don't  have a Mac version)

Thanks again for your help.  I've tried various combinations of:

  (save-image "my-image" 
              :environment t :multiprocessing t
              :restart-function 'env:start-environment)

With no new result.  I'll try it on my linux version when I have a chance.

The Listener window on the Mac is also not behaving normally, I can't
seem to get focus on the window for example.

Chris Dean

On Linux it works much better.  I get many X11 errors and I might need
to rebind *stanard-output*, but at least the windows come up.

If someone has an example delivery script that they use to create an
IDE image, I would appreciate a copy.

Thanks!

&gt BTW it's not a delivery script, as it calls SAVE-IMAGE rather than
&gt DELIVER. You can't deliver the IDE.

Ah yes, of course.  Thanks for the clarification.

Thanks everyone.   Following the documentation in 

  ftp://ftp.lispworks.com/pub/software_tools/reference/lw445/readme-4-4-5.pdf

worked great.

I did end up using a restart-function as shown here:

    (save-image
     #+:cocoa 
     (write-macos-application-bundle
      (merge-pathnames "lispworks-gui-dev" (hcl:get-working-directory)))

     #-:cocoa "lispworks-gui-dev"

     :environment t :multiprocessing t
     :restart-function 'env:start-environment)

Chris Dean

&gtI did.  It works fine.

Conclusion: the file with (ed "c:/path/foo.lisp") is not loaded 
at startup time or this form is not evaluated. BTW which 
LispWorks are you using ? I think you can't use an init file in the Personal Edition.
