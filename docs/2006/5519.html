                <h1>Berkeley DB on a Mac?</h1>
                <pre>

Has anyone gotten the berkeley-db package to work in LispWorks on a
Mac?  I'm running LispWorks 4.4.5 and BerkeleyDB 4.3.29 and
http://www.cliki.net/berkeley-db

I assume that it works on Linux, but I haven't tried that yet.

Any pointers or war stories on running BerkeleyDB appreciated.

Thanks!

(I have been using an in house btree implementation and it is just too
slow by a large margin to use for some of our applications.)

Chris Dean

                 <pre>Hi, Yes... I have been using BDB on the Mac with LWM for quite some time
now. In fact, just installed 4.20 on a Powerbook this morning. Very simple
to install on Mac, just use the Unix build instructions.

As for interfacing with LWM, I use the following C glue code and the
associated foreign-function interface code (attached)...
