Should I expect LWL to run on a 64-bit linux?

(It didn't in my case, so I downgraded to a 32-bit linux running on a 64-bit 
machine - just checking that this is the correct solution).

thanx

I'm running LWL on a 64bit SUSE10, with no problems whatsoever.

&gt   Paul&gt (It didn't in my case, so I downgraded to a 32-bit linux running on a 64-bit 
&gt   Paul&gt machine - just checking that this is the correct solution).
&gt
&gt Which 64-bit distro was this?  LispWorks runs fine on distros that have 32-bit
&gt compatibility libraries, for example Fedora Core 3.
Well it seems that the X server from Xorg? is not very liked with
LispWorks. I got a zillion of bugs using it and LW is getting flaky (I
doubt it's Lispworks, seems really to be the xorg server. 

Just an example
Open a class browser and I'm not able ot get rid of them again: 
Here are just a few messages:

Well I see the window very well but it still stick on the Desktop,
That does not happen always....

Would that be libXm.so? LW needs motif!

&gt Yes, thank you!  The mandriva 64-bit linux distro was simply missing motif.  
&gt It was included in the 32-bit distro's, so I'd forgotten about this issue 
&gt over time.  I installed the (32-bit) lesstif from the cd and am running lwl 
&gt under the 64-bit o/s.

Great! I think openmotif works a little better with LW than with
lesstif, though, but YMMV.
