                <h1>FLI conversion of types</h1>Is it possible in the FLI definition of a function to just force the conversion of numeric values to the proper type? For example, if I have the following foreign function:<br><br>(define-foreign-function (rotate-object &quot;RotateObject&quot;)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ((pitch :float)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (yaw :float)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (roll :float))<br>&nbsp; ...)<br><br>I can't call this with integer values:<br><br>(rotate-object 90 0 0) ; &lt;-- error<br><br>One would think that LW could just do the conversion of types automatically. Now, for contant values, this isn't much of a problem, because I can just put .0 on the end of the numbers and now it works. But when I use symbols, since they can technically represent anything, I have to wrap them with (float ...) in order to force the conversion. Likewise, I have to use (truncate ...) for integer parameters.
<br><br>Is there a way in the :lambda-list of the FLI definition to force (float) or (truncate)? If not, will future versions of LW just do this for me, please? :-)<br><br>Jeff M.<br clear="all"><br>-- <br><a href="mailto:massung@gmail.com">

i am using lisp personal edition LW4.4
i am facing problem with the lispwork itself when i am interpreting
some function which are not syntactically correct more than 3 or 4
times the lisp work automatically starts a dos prompt shell of lisp
interpretor and the gui lispwork stop works and on closing the dos
prompt shell the whole lisp work closes .
is i have to redownload the whole lispwork ?

thanx

&gt Hi Jeff &amp; Yasar,
&gt
&gt There is an example in the manual:
&gt
&gt http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw445/FLI/html/fli-162.htm
&gt
&gt You can define this as a named type using FLI:DEFINE-FOREIGN-TYPE, e.g.
&gt
&gt (fli:define-foreign-type integer-as-string ()
&gt   '(:wrapper :int
&gt               :lisp-to-foreign read-from-string
&gt               :foreign-to-lisp prin1-to-string))
&gt
&gt and conversions for float/int can be handled similarly.
