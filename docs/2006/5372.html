                <pre>
Hi,

I am experiencing the following behaviour with LWL 4.4.6. When my program  
(which conses a lot) approaches 128M or so, it occasionally stops doing  
anything and fully loads the preprocessor. I can simulate this behavior if  
I run (clean-down) from the REPL when the memory is close to that level.

I am running LWL under FreeBSD in Linux emulation mode, but I do know the  
inner workings of the linux mode on FreeBSD well enough to think that the  
problem is quite probably not freebsd-specific.

Did anyone else experience similar behaviour with LWL?

Just where should I look to find out what exactly is happening inside the  
garbage collector?

I don't have this problem with LWM, and cannot check with LWW.

David

&gt stops doing anything and fully loads the preprocessor.

The processor, sorry for the typo.

Just out of curiosity: Why doesn't the library-skipping mechanism
(which btw saved us a lot of trouble at Netfonds, since we had linux
servers with different layouts and had to build different images for
different linux memory layouts) work on FreeBSD? (Because there's no
/proc file system...?)
