                <h1>capi dividers</h1>
                <pre>
Under LWW 4.4.6, I can't seem to get dividers to show up.  I have a simple 
dialog with a menu, a toolbar (flat, non-dockable) and some stuff.  I want a 
divider between the menu and the toolbar and between the toolbar and the 
stuff.

:divider in the column-layout doesn't seem to do anything.

:dividerp t in the toolbars draws only partial dividers

:visible-border t draws a border only around the row-layout containing the 
toolbars, but doesn't stretch the "divider" to the far edge of the dialog.

The interface builder tool has a "Dividers" section, but it is empty.

I'm probably overlooking something obvious - a prod would be appreciated.

thanx

This app

  http://weitz.de/regex-coach/

(built with LWW 4.4.6) has dividers between the panes, created with
:DIVIDER in the column layout.  You don't see them, but if you move
your mouse over them, they become active and you can use them to
resize the panes.

See "resize dividers" here:

HTH,
Edi.

I think that comes from the XP "theme".  I usually use the "Classic"
theme, and I don't see a faint line there.

&gt (That's what I'm thinking a divider is).

AFAIU, in CAPI, a divider (in a layout) is "just" a resize handle.

Hello Paul,

I would recommend to try docking-layout, e.g.

  (top-docking  capi:docking-layout ()
   :items '((file-toolbar :title "File")
            (object-toolbar :title "Object"))
   :divider-p t)   ; separator between the toolbar and the menubar

Just fyi - the variable CAPI-INTERNALS:*LAYOUT-DIVIDER-DEFAULT-SIZE* seems
to control the size of the divider area - at least on LWW.
