                <pre>

I'm running my delivered app on Linux and occasionally it spits out
this message:

  &lt;**&gt Bad object in general 00000001 ptr 37ea4a4c previous 00000010
  &lt;**&gt Bad object in general 00000001 ptr 37ea4a4c previous 00000010

The app often keeps going, but sometimes in crashes at this point.

Some background on the code: The program has 64 threads running and
takes up about 600 MB of ram.  Mostly it does disk and network io, but
it does cons a fair amount as it calculates what to write to disk.
Sometimes it takes up a lot less ram (300 MB or so).  When it does
take less RAM it seems to be be "happier" and print out the messages
much less often.

Has anyone else seen this? Any ideas on how I could fix it? I'm guess
it's in GC, but I really don't know for sure.

Chris Dean

P.S.  Thanks to everyone on this list for all their help.  This has
      been a great community to be a part of and I really appreciate
      all of your help!

[Sorry, I cut off this part of the email]

On a crash, I get a message like this:

  ** &lt;&lt; SERIOUS PROBLEMS DURING GARBAGE COLLECTION    &gt&gt  **

  SIG = 0000000b  PC = 2005f77f
  Simple backtrace:

You say your app has reached 600mb; before restructuring things, our app at times exceeded 700mb on a 1GB machine and occassionally I'd see behavior similar to yours. I also think I saw a post here recently that mentioned image sizes in the ranges you and I have experienced approaches the location at which&nbsp;shared libraries&nbsp;are mapped, but I don't recall if this was Windows or some other platform.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We changed certain algorithms in our system to keep image sizes generally below 200mb, but that might not be an option for you.</div>

Great info, thanks.  

I have plenty of memory (4 GB on those machines), but I'll try
partitioning into 2 copies each running 32 threads and see if that
helps.

We partitioned down to 24 threads on each copy (about 300mb for each
image) and still have the same problem.  Thanks for the advice,
though.

We have a system with very similar parameters to what you describe.
We have problems identical to yours.  We have tried to debug them
for over a year.  In a large system, with lots of FLI code, it's
hard to ever point the finger at any one thing, but I think there
is a problem with the GC.  I'm sad to say I don't have a lot of hope
for a fix at this point, besides the "voodoo programming let's rearrange
the world and hope it works" type "fix".

I'd be happy to compare notes with you privately about what our
system loads etc to help track down commonalities, if you wish.

That's too bad - I hoped I was unique enough that it would turn out to
be an some obvious error on part.  For what it's worth, I have no FFI
code in the app that is crashing.

Thanks for the information.

I am delivering at level 0.  But thanks for the suggestion!
