                <pre>
WinXP
LispWorks 4.4.6
(LW:LISP-IMAGE-NAME) =&gt "C:\\Program Files\\LispWorks\\lispworks-4450.exe"

*init-file-name* =&gt "~/.lispworks"
But somewhere LispWorks "knows" to load and partially evaluate
C:\Program Files\LispWorks\MyConfig\a-dot-lispworks.lisp
I say partially because I can put a dummy at the end of the ini file like:
(setf dlgreene-x "Hello this is a test!")

And sure enough
dlgreene-x =&gt "Hello this is a test!"

I used set ...a-dot-lispworks.lisp in the LispWorks Configure dialog. I'm
assuming that this goes into the registry... And that's fine... Why doesn't
LispWorks report it as the current ini file? Meaning why do I get this
*init-file-name* =&gt "~/.lispworks"
(No such file exists!... I did look.)

There are a couple of other issues that come up related to this... For
instance reading through the archive I found a thread related to utf-8 and I
loaded the following into my ini:
(setf (editor:variable-value "Output Format Default") '(:utf-8 :eol-style
:crlf))
(setf (editor:variable-value "Input Format Default") '(:utf-8 :eol-style
:crlf))

I query LW
(editor:variable-value "Output Format Default") =&gt (:DEFAULT :EOL-STYLE
:CRLF)
(editor:variable-value "Input Format Default") =&gt :DEFAULT

These are the "LW Configure" settings that I set because utf-8 isn't
available in that dialog. If I run the setf's in LW listner I do get what I
set.

At the top of my a-dot-lispworks.lisp I do have:
(load-all-patches)
(load "C:\\Program Files\\LispWorks\\MyConfig\\configure.lisp")

The config file is just a copy of the original that came with LispWorks. I
can double click the LW exe from explorere or use the shortcut that is:
"C:\Program Files\LispWorks\lispworks-4450.exe" -siteinit -
Which I think is supposed to "short out" the default configure.lisp.

I have NOT done the "image thing" I am in no way ready to fiddle around with
that yet! I can't get the help to work for LispWorks yet. I search for help
on editor variable and a page comes up saying something like "You can set
editor variables and you can get editor variables" and that's it! I guess
what the editor variables are is figured out by osmosis.

O.K. but what about the more critical issue of only partially evaluating the
preferences file. The font and as I stated the utf-8 issue. How do I get
that stuff to work? Or what is evaluated and what isn't? Or how to I get the
font that I set in Global Preferences dialog? How can I override the utf-8
setting?

I assume that this is a problem. How do I (as a newbie) "short out" the
Global Preferences dialog with a VERY simple set of settings that are a good
approximation of what is in the Global preferences dialog?

Thanks... I'm not going completely crazy.

&gt "C:\Program Files\LispWorks\lispworks-4450.exe" -siteinit -
I'm a bone head... It does say siteinit doesn't it. I don't know how I
confused that with configure.lisp. So because I have (load-all-patches) at
the top of my a-dot-lispworks.lisp and my a-dot-lispworks.lisp is set in the
LispWorks Configure dialog loading configure.lisp is redundant and at the
outside damaging... Thanks!

When you are looking at the problem:
*init-file-name* =&gt "~/.lispworks"
But the setting in LW config dialog is working and is NOT that setting. I
know this is documented and extremely unlikely to cause a problem still...
In this case it would seem prudent to overwrite the variable and over
document this action in the default a-dot-lispworks.lisp from LW. When in a
frazzled state as a newbie plus querying the listener it is quite baffling.
#|
If you set your init file name in the LW dialog box this WILL BE IGNORE AND
MORE OVER BE OVERWRITTEN!!!
This is so the listener WILL report the current init file under ALL
circumstances after initilization!
|#

Now....
Where's the font? Where's the font? The global font that is. The one I set
in LW configure dialog. How do I get that font to be used when I create a
capi:editor-pane? If that's not possible where it the variable within
LispWorks? It would appear that this variable is suffering from a similar
issue? The only problem is I can't figure out what to query in the listener
to verify the problem.

Last but not least My LW config dialog is somewhat "confused" at this point
but I set the "Input/Output Format Default" to UTF-8 using regedt32 and both
variables are being reported correctly by the listener. Again the LW config
dialog is "blank" on these issues. Further I haven't used anything enough to
know if the settings have actually "taken" or not... I only know that the
listener is reporting correctly for both input and output =&gt(:UTF-8
:EOL-STYLE :CRLF)

Thanks for answers!

Sorry, this is a bug that the IDE preferences override the variable -- we
will
fix it.

Passing -siteinit - doesn't affect configure.lisp (which is preloaded into
the
image).  It just prevents the siteinit.lisp from being loaded.
