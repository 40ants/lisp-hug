                <h1>:DEFAULT-P vs. focus</h1>
                <pre>
If I create a dialog like below, the ESC and RETURN keys cease to work
as expected although :DEFAULT-P and :CANCEL-P are used.  This is
obviously due to setting the focus to the pinboard layout.

Is there a way to code around this?

Thanks,
Edi.

Sure, this was just to illustrate the problem.  In my application I
have an interface with a pinboard layout and OK and Cancel buttons.
As soon as the user does something in the pinboard layout, the layout
has the focus, and at that point RETURN and ESC no longer work.

Did you try to set the accepts-focus initarg to NIL on the pinboard-layout ?

(defun foo ()
  (let* ((pinboard (make-instance 'capi:pinboard-layout :accepts-focus-p
nil))
         (ok-button (make-instance 'capi:push-button
                                   :default-p t
                                   :text "OK"
                                   :callback-type :none
                                   :callback (lambda ()
                                               (capi:exit-dialog :ok))))
         (cancel-button (make-instance 'capi:push-button
                                       :cancel-p t
                                       :text "Cancel"
                                       :callback #'capi:abort-dialog))
         (layout (make-instance 'capi:row-layout
                                :description (list pinboard ok-button
cancel-button)))
         (dialog (make-instance 'capi:interface
                                :title "Test"
                                :layout layout)))

    ;For me the create-callback is unnecessary

    (capi:display-dialog dialog :focus OK-BUTTON)))

No, I wouldn't have thought of that because to me (from my
understanding of the docs) it meant that the pinboard layout isn't
usable at all.  But it works - I can still use the pinboard layout and
the problem with the buttons is gone.  Thanks!

&gt     ;For me the create-callback is unnecessary

As I said to Dave, this was just to quickly illustrate the problem.

Thanks,
Edi.

Thanks.  I thought of that but it turns out that Denis' hint solved my
immediate problem.

&gt Methinks that capi:interface has a method/function that can be

Is it documented somewhere?

Thanks,
Edi.
