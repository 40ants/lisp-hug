This is happening to us as well! We're evaluating LW 5.0 on Linux Enterprise
4.3.

Subject: Lisp executable corrupted (lw pro linux 32-bit)



Hi,

I install lw5 pro on fedora core 4 with this command.

% rpm -ivh lispworks-5.0-1.i386.rpm

It works fine for a day and the next day I return to work I see this

% /usr/lib/LispWorks/lispworks-5-0-0-x86-linux -tty
Lisp executable apparently corrupted. (Truncated?) Cannot restart.

However, the vanilla image that I saved yesterday continue to work

% ~/bin/lw5000-console
LispWorks(R): The Common Lisp Programming Environment
Copyright (C) 1987-2006 LispWorks Ltd.  All rights reserved.
Version 5.0.0
; Loading text file /usr/lib/LispWorks/lib/5-0-0-0/config/siteinit.lisp
;  Loading text file
/usr/lib/LispWorks/lib/5-0-0-0/private-patches/load.lisp
CL-USER 1 &gt

So I need to remove and reinstall the rpm

% rpm -e lispworks-5.0-1
% sh lwl-license.sh
% rpm -ivh lispworks-5.0-1.i386.rpm

I want to make sure that this is reproducible so I install a fresh
copy of FC4 on vmware, and the result is the same.

For the time being this doesn't bother me that much because I can
still use the saved image to do my work.

However, I have a daily rpm build script that automate the lw delivery
(a console application) and package it as a binary rpm package.

If I install this rpm and run the delivered image I see the above
error again.

However, if I just do a "tar cvfz" and copy it to the target machine I
don't have this problem. I was wondering if this is related to the rpm
build mechanism or fedora core 4?

BTW, I search "executable corrupted" on this forum and no threads 
turn up so I'm assuming no one has encountered this problem?

Thanks,
