Hi

since we are talking "ontologies", after Francis' message, let it be 
known that I we have just completed a new version of our time-course 
enrichment tool GOALIE.  Tools that do "enrichment" are an important 
part of biologists and bioinformaticians bag of tricks.

GOALIE is a twist on enrichment programs, as it adds another dimension 
to the usual analysis tools out there.  In fact it allows the user to 
perform enrichment over a time course and to see what categories are 
"up" and "down" regulated along the time axis.

A simple, Gantt-like chart display conveys this information, while a 
more complex graph display allows for finer inspection of clusters, 
probes, genes and ontology terms.

You can download GOALIE from our website

	http://bioinformatics.nyu.edu/Projects/GOALIE

we welcome feedback and (loving) criticism.

GOALIE is a full blown Lispworks application which directly links in 
the Gene Ontology database.  It also reuses several little bits and 
pieces I have written over the years and never quite released :)  In 
any case, it is another example of the kind of gasps you get from 
audiences (believe me!) who do not know Common Lisp.

Thanks for your attention
