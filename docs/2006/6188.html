No, it's guaranteed erroneous on non-english Windows.


In fact, (sys:get-folder-path :my-documents) should do exactly what Sheldon Ball wants it to. The problem may well be with the unorthodox path-building with concatenate.

The error number, 5, is probably form Windows. If so, it means "No access". Perhaps the user doesn't have the right to create subdirectories in his 'Mine dokumenter' (would be strange though).


Actually, reading the original post again, I see that the error message concerns the directory

C:\Documents and Settings\Sheldon Ball\vhamacballsh\My Documents\

which seems to have two usernames in its path. Perhaps it should have been

C:\Documents and Settings\vhamacballsh\My Documents\

So the error may indeed be the path-building.

Yes.  In my italian version I would have to do

	(merge-pathnames "Documenti/" (user-homedir-pathname))

&gt In fact, (sys:get-folder-path :my-documents) should do exactly what 
&gt Sheldon Ball wants it to.

sys:get-folder-path is LW dependent and the assumption about the 
existence of a "My Document" is Windows dependent. Moreover, 
internationalization issues go beyond the location of "My Documents".

&gt The problem may well be with the unorthodox path-building with 
&gt concatenate.

Yes.  Using CONCATENATE to manipulate pathnames is a recipe for endless 
annoyances (although LW is particularly good to make several of these 
issues go away)
