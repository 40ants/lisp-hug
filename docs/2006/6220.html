                <h1>clsql delivery with LispWorks Windows.</h1>
                <pre>
Not sure whether this should go here or to the clsql mailing list...
I'm trying to deliver an app using clsql/sqlite3 as my datastore, but
I don't think lispworks/clsql manages to pick up its dll.

Again, I'm trying to run this from a thumbdrive, and dump my
executable, sqlite3.dll and clsql_uffi.dll (and clsql_uffi.lib) in
the same directory. The application manages to start up,
do a text query (comparing the schema of the existing database
with what it expects to find) and build a new database.
So the sqlite3.dll should be fine, but when I try to do a
query requiring the clsql uffi, it fails.

Is there any specific requirements as to where the dll should
be located, or have I missed something else? The application
is delivered at level 0.

That's a problem with CLSQL that you should take to the CLSQL mailing
list.  The location of the helper DLL is hard-coded at delivery time
and thus it is not found at execution time.

I sent a patch[1] to fix this behaviour last year, but it was somehow
(unintentionally, I guess) overwritten or deactivated in a recent
release.  I was also annoyed by this, but haven't yet found the time
to send a new patch.

Cheers,
Edi.

I sent an email (Through gmane) but I guess I have to subscribe for the
email to go through. Anyway I found a solution that works for me,
I add the directory with teh DLL to *foreign-library-search-paths* and
calls load-uffi-foreign-library in my deliver.lisp to force clsql to search
for the library again:

(deliver (lambda ()
           (push (make-pathname :name nil :type nil :defaults (lisp-image-name))
                 clsql:*foreign-library-search-paths*)
           (clsql-uffi::load-uffi-foreign-library)
           (launch t)) "Myapp" 0 :interface :capi)
