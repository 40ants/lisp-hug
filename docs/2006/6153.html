                <h1>does LispWorks have a function for copying files?</h1>
                <pre>

Could you point me to the right function? I couldn't find one in the 
documentation. Or do I need to write my own? If the latter, would a 
loop that calls read-char and write-chare do the job correctly for 
arbitrary files (i.e. nor just text files, but also Excel Word etc)?

     Thanks,

	Mark

FWIW, Edi Weitz's CL-FAD (files and directories) includes a generic  
copy-file command as does my metatilities. Both of these libraries  
are ASDF-Installable.

To be on the safe side, I would use READ-BYTE and WRITE-BYTE and open
the files with element-type (UNSIGNED-BYTE 8).

(And you may get higher performance if you use READ-SEQUENCE and
WRITE-SEQUENCE.  Then again, you may not...)

Maybe there's a better way, but I think this should work. It treats the file 
as binary and reads bytes:

(with-open-file (in-str in-filename :direction :input :element-type 
'(unsigned-byte 8))

  (with-open-file (out-str out-filename :direction :output :element-type 
'(unsigned-byte 8))
     (do ((ubyte (read-byte in-str nil) (read-byte in-str nil)))
          ((null ubyte))
        (write-byte ubyte out-str))))

Hmm, what about

http://www.cl-http.org:8000/cl-http/lispdoc?package=HTTP&amp;symbol=COPY- 
FILE&amp;type=FUNCTION&amp;apropos=copy%2Bfile

Or  (http::apropos* '(copy file) :http 'function)?
FTP-COPY-FILE [function]: (FROM-URL TO-STREAM &amp;KEY)
WITH-COPY-FILE-ENVIRONMENT [macro]: ((FROM TO STREAM &amp;OPTIONAL (BLOCK- 
NAME (QUOTE COPY-FILE))) &amp;BODY BODY)
FILE-URL-COPY-FILE-TO-HTTP-STREAM [function]: (FILE-URL-OR-PATHNAME  
HTTP-STREAM &amp;KEY CONTENT-TYPE URL ADDITIONAL-HEADERS USER-ID USER-PW)
COPY-FILE [function]: (SOURCE DESTINATION &amp;KEY COPY-MODE REPORT- 
STREAM REQUEST-HEADERS USER-EMAIL-ADDRESS &amp;ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS)
CONDITIONAL-COPY-FILE [function]: (FROM-PATHNAME TO-PATHNAME &amp;KEY  
&amp;ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS)
FILE-URL-COPY-FILE [function]: (FILE-URL-OR-PATHNAME TO-STREAM &amp;KEY
