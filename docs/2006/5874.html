                <h1>URL in a rich-text-pane</h1>
                <pre>
Hi,

I am trying to programmatically turn a URL in a rich-text-pane into a  
highlighted, clickable link.  If I manually select the text in the  
pane and right click, OS X gives me an option "Make Link", but I  
would like to do this automatically when the pane is created or  
displayed.  Any suggestions?

Thanks,
-Chris

                 <pre>
I am using XMLS:parse on a 500KB file and it takes four minutes.  Is this 
normal?  Is there a faster alternative?  Thank you.

I think if that's fast or not depends very much on the contents of the
file and on your machine.

There are several other Lisp XML parsers out there:

  http://www.cl-user.net/asp/tags/XML
  http://www.cliki.net/XML

I've found CXML to be pretty nice.

                 <h1>Text/editor pane vs list pane, design decision</h1>
                 <pre>
Hi,

I've noticed that text-input-panes differ from things like list panes,
in that they don't hold arbitrary objects; only text. Wouldn't it be an
improvement to let them contain arbitrary objects, and have them use a
print function to find a textual representation?

I understand that text panes are modifiable in ways that list panes
aren't. However, the underlying objects within list panes are also
modifiable. And it'd be convenient to get the underlying textpane object
in addition to the (user-modifiable) textpane text.



MfG,
Tayssir

Note that text input panes have a change callback, so you can subclass
them and implement the behaviour you want.  I've done something
similar for a project I'm working on, but I'm afraid I can't show you
the code as it's proprietary.

Cheers,
Edi.
