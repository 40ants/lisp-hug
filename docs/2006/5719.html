This is great news!
Does this mean that you guys are now all going into holiday to recover ?

&gt LispWorks 5.0 brings these new features:
&gt
&gt * Support for Intel-based Macintosh machines and universal binaries
&gt * New 64-bit implementations on Windows, Macintosh and Linux platforms

I have a question about the differences between the 32 and 64 bit  
versions,
since there is a large price difference (and a forced upgrade to the  
enterprise variant):

Are there any more differences apart from the larger heap size (and  
increased array, string, fixnum sizes / limits) ?
Is the 64 bit version recommended for normal use, or only for those  
who have run into limitations in the past ?
Are there speed differences ? Maybe 64 bit processing is overkill and  
slower in most cases ?
Is it correct that the Mac Intel (and thus the Universal binary)  
version is only 32 bit for now ?

&gt If and when Apple introduce a 64-bit Intel-based machine

"If and when" :-) I'd be really disappointed if they introduce that
any later than next monday....

Congratulations on the release - the list of improvements and new
features is really impressing!
