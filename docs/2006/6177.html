                <pre>
Hi,

I am having two problems with tree-views that appear to be bugs.  I  
am using LispWorks 4.4.6 on OS X 10.4.7.

* Horizontal-scrolling does not seem to work.  If an item is longer  
than the pane width, it is cropped at word boundaries rather than  
enabling the horizontal scroll bar. This is problematic since  
cropping at word boundaries makes it appear that the entire text is  
displayed.

* Popup menus do not seem to work at all.  Right clicking on an item  
causes /something/ to happen, as the next click on the pane is  
ignored.  But no context menu is displayed. If the same code is used  
on a pinboard-layout instead of a tree-view, then it works fine.

Both problems are illustrated in the sample code below.  Try resizing  
the pane and right clicking on it.

Sorry, this doesn't help you: On Windows it works like you expect.

For what it's worth, the popup menu seems to work on LispWorks 5.0 (OS
X 10.4.8), but I am getting the same strange behavior with the tree
view.
