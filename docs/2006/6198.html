                <h1>Lockups while completing symbols?</h1>
                <pre>
I'm running LispWorks 5.0 on OS X 10.4 (Tiger).  From time to time,
when I try to complete a symbol, I get the Pinwheel of Death and I'm
unable to get LispWorks to respond to me.  The editor cursor continues
flashing, but nothing I do can get LispWorks alive again.  The
Processes button on the podium doesn't respond and C-g has no effect.
 My only recourse is to Force Quit LispWorks.

Unfortunately, I can't pin down exactly what circumstances cause the
problem.  It doesn't happen all the time (of course), but it does seem
to happen most frequently when I'm typing quickly.  Perhaps there is
some keychord that I'm unwittingly pressing after I press C-M-i that
confuses LW?

Does anyone else have a problem like this?  I will post more
information if I can narrow down what causes it, but having to Force
Quit LispWorks and then come back into it is getting frustrating.

This error seems to be specific to the LispWorks completion dialog,
since I have yet to have this occur when using Edi Weitz's "Complete
Symbol Without Dialog."  I am using that in the meantime, but I do
prefer the GUI completion dialog.

Just in case this was making anyone nervous, the embarassing truth is
that this problem ended up being my own fault.  I'd bound one of my
own commands to C-M-o.  Apparently, I would sometimes strike C-M-o
instead of C-M-i and in certain cases this would cause my command to
enter an infinite loop, locking up the editor.

So, sorry for the false alarm.  :)  The IDE's completion command seems
to be fine.
