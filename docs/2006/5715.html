                <h1>read-from-string and errors</h1>
                <pre>
Hello all,

I'm reading the doc for read-from-string, and I see the following:


"Description:
....
If an object is successfully parsed, the primary value, object, is the
object that was parsed. If eof-error-p is false and if the end of the
substring is reached, eof-value is returned. "


However, I'm getting:

CL-USER 11 &gt (read-from-string "(car" nil :EOF)

Error: End of file while reading stream #&lt;System::String-Input-Stream 104408B7&gt.
  1 (abort) Return to level 0.
  2 Return to top loop level 0.

Type :b for backtrace, :c &lt;option number&gt to proceed,  or :? for other options

CL-USER 12 : 1 &gt

and I think that I'm unclear on when read-from-string is suppoed to
signal an error. It would seem
to me that no object was sucessfully parsed, that  eof-error-p is
false, and that the end of the
substring was reached, and as such I should get the eof-value, :EOF.
If this isn't correct, then
in what cases would end of string be reached and the eof-value
returned without some other
error coming first? ( know of one case, the empty string, e.g.,
(read-from-string "" nil :EOF)).

Thanks!

Under "Exceptional Situations" it says:

  "An error is signaled if the end of the substring occurs in the
   middle of an incomplete object."

I think that is what you're seeing.

Cheers,
Edi.

That would explain it. I guess I thought I encountered an end of file
before I finished
reading the documentation. -_-;
