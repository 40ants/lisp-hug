                <h1>LW 4.2 on Fedora core 5?</h1>
                <pre>
Has anyone managed to get this working?  I realise it's now a very  
old version of LW but (alas) we can't justify an upgrade, and I  
seriously don't want to have to reimplement all my LW tools in  
something else.

The problem seems basically to be that Linux is maintained by 10 year  
olds who think it's just fine to change things randomly between  
releases, and I can no longer remember what I did to get it to work  
last time and stupidly did not write it down carefully enough.  We  
had it working fine on FC3, but it is not happy about Motif in FC5  
(which has openmotif I think, but they moved the libraries somewhere  
else, and bumped the version to 4 from 2).  I tried installing  
lesstif (current one from lesstif.org), which installs more- 
recognisable libraries but it still seems unhappy.  It does run, but  
can't find the libs so the IDE doesn't start.

I suppose the ultimate answer is a non-10-year-old-maintained OS, but  
there are precious few - Solaris seems to have now been invaded by  
them, so I guess that leaves windows, which is only saved by them not  
being able to get a release out more than once every 10 years.  Mac  
OS I suppose might be, though Steve Jobs is kind of the definition of  
a 10 year old...

Thanks
