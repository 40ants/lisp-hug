                <pre>
Does anyone have sample code (or knowledge to share) on how to get the Adobe 
Acrobat (7.0) browser control (aka "AcroPDF.PDF" and "PDF.PdfCtrl") working 
in a capi pane?

I'm unfamiliar with OLE/OCX/ActiveX/et al and the learning curve is painful 
for such a seemingly simple task :-).  All I really need is to load (and 
re-load) files into a pdf control.

I still haven't located the documentation of the API for this control - even 
knowing where that is, would help...

Thanx

Sorry for the late reply on this but I just realized that the LW html-viewer
example can use AcroPDF.PDF via Shell.Explorer. Just point the html-viewer
example at a PDF file and it effectively gives you the AcroPDF control. The
example is at:

LispWorks\lib\5-0-0-0\examples\com\ole\html-viewer.lisp

Not exactly what you asked for, but it might help...

btw for documenation I often just use the OLE View tool that came with MS VS6.0
- Microsoft Visual Studio\Common\Tools\OLEVIEW.EXE
You can load AcroPDF.dll using the View TypeLib toolbar button and get  the
IDL of the API.

Finally, I had a quick try at  modifying the html-viewer example to use
AcroPDF directly and I did not get it to work. Other people seem to use it
via Shell.Explorer - I assume because of problems using it directly.

Did you get it working ?
