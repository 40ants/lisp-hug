Overview
********

"...Please don't assume Lisp is only useful for Animation and Graphics,
AI, Bioinformatics, B2B and E-Commerce, Data Mining, EDA/Semiconductor
applications, Expert Systems, Finance, Intelligent Agents, Knowledge
Management, Mechanical CAD, Modeling and Simulation, Natural Language,
Optimization, Research, Risk Analysis, Scheduling, Telecom, and Web
Authoring just because these are the only things they happened to
list."
   -- Kent Pitman

Lisp is one of the oldest computer languages still in use today. In
the decades of its existence, Lisp has been a fruitful basis for
language design experiments as well as the preferred implementation
language for applications in diverse fields.

The structure of Lisp makes it easy to extend the language or even to
implement entirely new dialects without starting from scratch. Common
Lisp, with the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS), was the first
object-oriented programming language to receive an ANSI standard and
retains the most complete and advanced object system of any
programming language, while influencing many other object-oriented
programming languages that followed.

It is clear that Lisp is gaining momentum: there is a
steadily growing interest in Lisp itself, with numerous user groups
in existence worldwide, and in Lisp's metaprogramming notions
which are being transferred to other languages, as
for example in Aspect-Oriented Programming, support for
Domain-Specific Languages, and so on.

This two-day workshop will address the near-future role of Lisp-based
languages in research, industry and education. We solicit
papers and suggestions for breakout groups that discuss the
opportunities Lisp provides to capture and enhance the possibilities
in software engineering. We want to promote lively discussion
between researchers proposing new approaches and practitioners
reporting on their experience with the strengths and limitations of
current Lisp technologies.

The workshop will have two components on separate days; there will
be a day for formally-presented talks, and a day for breakout groups
discussing or working on particular topics.  Additionally, there
will be opportunities for short, informal talks and demonstrations on
experience reports, underappreciated results, software under
development, or other topics of interest.

Papers
******

Formal presentations in the workshop should take between 20 minutes
and half an hour; additional time will be given for questions and
answers. We encourage that papers be published on the website in order
to provide background information in advance.

Suggested Topics

New language features or abstractions
Experience reports or case studies
Protocol Metaprogramming and Libraries
Educational approaches
Software Evolution
Development Aids
Persistent Systems
Dynamic Optimization
Implementation techniques
Innovative Applications
Hardware Support for Lisp systems
Macro-, reflective-, meta- and/or rule-based development approaches
Aspect-Oriented, Domain-Oriented and Generative Programming

Breakout Groups
***************

The workshop will provide for the opportunity to meet face to face and
work on focused topics. We will organize these breakout groups and
provide for rooms and infrastructure.

Suggested Topics for Breakout Groups

Lisp Infrastructure Development and Distribution
Language Features (e.g. Predicate Dispatching)
Environments for creating web applications
Brainstorming sessions for new or existing open source projects
Persistence Systems
Compiler technology
Lisp on bare metal / Lisp hardware / Lisp operating systems
Compare and enhance curricula for computer science education

Submission Guidelines
*********************

Potential attendees are encouraged to submit

* a long paper (10 pages) presenting scientific and/or
   empirical results about Lisp-based uses or new approaches for
   software engineering purposes;

* a short essay (5 pages) defending a position about where
   research, practice or education based on Lisp should be heading in
   the near future;

* a proposal for a breakout group (1-2 pages) describing the theme, an
   agenda and/or expected results.

Submissions should be mailed as PDF to Pascal Costanza (pc@p-cos.net)
before the submission deadline.
