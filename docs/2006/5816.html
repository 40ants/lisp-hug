                <h1>SigLab Source Available</h1>
                <pre>
In response to all the requests, we have finally made the first batch of
sources available for our SigLab block-diagram programming system for signal
processing, which was presented in Hamburg at the April International
Conference.


Bear in mind that these sources have grown organically over the past 7
years. We use them on a routine basis for our work, but they were never
written for general distribution. Rather, they are the work of a mad
scientist for his own use. So please forgive the crude appearance of them in
many places.


Support tools required are Aquaterm (a modified version included) for
graphics visualization, and FFTW in some places for high-speed
double-precision FFT's (also included in the archive -- we use the Mac VSDP
libs elsewhere for single-precision work). All of our C glue code is
included in the archive.


This version for Mac is based on the use of Lispworks 4.4.6.


If you have questions about getting it up and running I will try to respond
to your e-mails. There are plenty of examples included in the folder
Siglab/Examples. While it can be used to solve systems of coupled
differential-equations, our most common use is for simulating signal
processing chains.


You can download the archive of source files at:

Look for the package "Mac Siglab Package.zip"


The package for Win32 will follow shortly...

                 <h1>append-next-kill not an editor command?</h1>
                 <pre>
It looks like append-next-kill (C-M-w) is not known by the Lispworks Emacs 
emulator.  Is there some obvious alternative which appends text to previous 
killed text for subsequent yanking as one unit? Maybe some other Emacs idiom 
is commonly used to do thi?
