                <h1>LWL 5.0: Severe problems with MP and 2.6.7 kernel</h1>
                <pre>
I have a Debian system with a 2.6.7 kernel and on this machine I can't
use MP: As soon as a process finishes, the complete Lisp image quits
immediately.  It suffices to evaluate something as simple as

  (mp:process-run-function "foo" nil (lambda ()))

and - boom...

I'm aware that this is probably not a supported configuration for LWL
5.0, but is this a known problem?  Is 2.6.7 too old or somehow buggy?

Thanks,
Edi.

Debian sarge (3.1) or newer, I assume, since you're running LW 5 on
it?

It's very old. I checked, and couldn't find anything older than 2.6.8
on our 2.6-machines. Unfortunately, that machine has debian woody, so
I can't check LW 5 on it.

But if the machine happens to be a AMD 64 X2: We experienced some
serious clock/timing issues which my colleagues solved by installing a
newer 2.6 kernel . These problems seriously affected multiprocessing
on LW 4.4.5 (sleep would occasionally sleep endlessly). 

Hmm. This is probably not very helpful - but at least I can confirm
that LW 5 + debian works just fine with newer kernels:

I can confirm that LW 5 and LW 5-based binaries run excellently on
at least the following systems:

debian sarge + linux 2.6.15.6
debian unstable + linux 2.6.13.2
debian sarge + linux 2.6.17.6
debian sarge 64-bit + linux 2.6.17.13 64-bit (LW 5 64-bit too)

I don't know how much it applies to LW5, but previous versions were
extremely sensitive to library versions- motif/lesstif in particular.
The symptom was LW would crash pretty easily with a slightly different
version than that specified, and stable otherwise.

I've used 4.3 on 2.4 and 2.6 kernels, from Redhat 9 thru Fedora Core 3
and its been stable on all- once the right motif/lesstif libraries were
in place.
