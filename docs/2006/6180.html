                <pre>
Using Mac OS X and LW 4.4.5, a dialog could contain both text-input- 
panes and multi-line-text-input-panes. You could navigate from one to  
the other using the tab and the subsequent pane was highlighted or  
focussed or whatever the appropriate term is. The only different  
between the panes was that one allowed more lines to be typed.

In LW 5.0, both the behavior and appearance of the multi-line-text- 
input-pane has changed. Navigation using tab does not seem possible.  
The focus doesn't happen. And the appearance is very different from a  
text-input-pane.

Does anyone know what you can do in LW 5 to get the behavior and  
appearance which was possible in 4.4.5 on a Mac? Any suggestions  
concerning keywords, undocumented variables, enz. would be appreciated.

Paul
