Hello,

LWW Pro 4.4.6

I have an interface that contains a tab-layout with three tabs. Each tab has a layout with some panes in. When the interface is created, the panes on the first tab are also created. The panes on the other tabs are not created until I switch to them (by clicking with the mouse).

However, I want to fill a multi-line-text-input pane on the third tab with some text programmatically, so it's there if the user ever looks at it. It fails, since the pane doesn't exist. I tought I could get notified when the pane was created, via a callback. The callback could fill the pane with the text. But my callback is never called.

So, 1) what is the way I should have done this, and 2) why doesn't my callback get called?


I have included below the complete definition of the interface (built by the interface-builder). The callback functions are not shown. In desperation, I tried adding a title-pane and a push-button-pane to the third layout (the runtime-status-layout). But their :focus callbacks are not called either. The only callback I'm able to have called, is the callback when the user presses the button (push-button-1), but then it's too late, and that's not what I want.

Thank you.

BTW, I'll be away the coming week, probably without e-mail, so if anyone asks me a follow-up question my answer will be late.

Hello Eivind,

| Hello,
|
| LWW Pro 4.4.6
|
| I have an interface that contains a tab-layout with three tabs. Each
| tab has a layout with some panes in. When the interface is created, the
| panes on the first tab are also created. The panes on the other tabs
| are not created until I switch to them (by clicking with the mouse).
|
| However, I want to fill a multi-line-text-input pane on the third tab
| with some text programmatically, so it's there if the user ever looks
| at it. It fails, since the pane doesn't exist. I tought I could get
| notified when the pane was created, via a callback. The callback could
| fill the pane with the text. But my callback is never called.
|
| So, 1) what is the way I should have done this, and 2) why doesn't my
| callback get called?
|...snip...|

For such purpose, I fill in the tab-layout with items that are instances of
the tab-page-mixin and provide the following hack to invoke the
create-callback of my own (tested only on LWW):

(defclass tab-page-mixin ()
 (;; Signature: (interface tab-page-mixin)
  (create-callback :reader create-callback :initarg :create-callback
:initform nil)
))

(defmethod CAPI::MAYBE-INSTALL-DESCRIPTION :around
         ((tab-page-mixin tab-page-mixin))
  (let ((result (call-next-method)))
    (unless result
      (when-let (create-callback (create-callback tab-page-mixin))
        ;; Simply clobber the callback as it is of no value any longer.
        (setf (slot-value tab-page-mixin 'create-callback) nil)
        (funcall create-callback (capi:element-interface tab-page-mixin)
tab-page-mixin)))
    result))
