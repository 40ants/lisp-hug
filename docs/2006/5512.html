                <pre>

What's the best way to deploy an app to a cluster of servers?

I have a LispWorks application that I deliver to a cluster of Linux
boxes.  Right now we run about a dozen copies of the same program
(with slightly different configuration files) on a dozen different
machines.  We expect the number of machines to increase drastically
over the next year or two. We/I have complete control over these
machines and they don't do anything else except run our application.

On one of the development boxes we have a delivery script to make a
single executable and we copy that executable out to the different
machines.  The final executable parses its command line and starts
up -- not much different from a C program.

What's the best way to deploy this app?  For example, it would be nice
to have a repl to connect to so that we could diagnose misbehaving
apps.   Here's what we've thought of:

- Leave as is, no repl.
- Embed a swank server.
- Embed a simple repl listening on a TCP port.
- Use detachtty.
- Don't use deliver, just save an image (not sure if that is within
  our LispWorks license) and deploy using detachtty.

Also, we can deploy the source code if that is useful for some reason.

Maybe "best way" is a misnomer, I'm really looking for how you would
solve a similar problem.  Thanks!

Regards,
Chris Dean

Sounds like an interesting project: maybe you should write something  
about it someday!

In terms of licensing you cannot work with source code distribution:  
that would require a file compiler and thus a full license on each  
machine. 'Cannot' is too strong of course, 1100 per server is still  
quite cheap compared to other server technologies.

I would add another requirement to your list:
- the ability to update running images with new code (patches,  
extensions, ...) without taking them down.

My current system (which I would like to improve because it takes  
some time to set up) is as follows:

I have a skeleton server image called lw-base: this is an almost  
empty level-0 delivered tty mp image.
It contains some directory/location management code and the standard  
asdf code.

When this image boots, it loads a config file from its own etc dir,  
that in most case starts loading precompiled fasl files from asdf.  
The asdf is set up to load from its own sys and dist directories - to  
make everything self contained.

The image itself is managed by an lw-ctl script: this makes it easier  
to start/stop/restart/kill/... the process.

The image is not started directly, but using screen (detaching  
automatically). Reconnecting to the startup repl is done by  
reattaching to the startup listener.

Updating server code is done from a special mirror setup on a  
development machine: a single deploy script checks code out from  
different repositories, compiles it using asdf in the local tree and  
rsyncs the fasl files to the server.

On the server, a single asdf command is often all it takes to load  
the (new) code; since everything is precompiled, the file compiler is  
not needed. I ofter do small patches by copying and pasting functions  
in the repl on the server; the evaluator is available in delivered  
images.

On some projects I also load swank and use slime to connect to the  
server image: it is a higher level, more functional interface.

PS: In the past I used to work with custom repl code but found that  
unreliable when debugging certain mp conditions, a common situation  
with server code.

Great advice!  Thanks so much.

I think I'll try out a variant of your setup.
