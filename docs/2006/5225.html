                <h1>XML Parser for LispWorks</h1>
                <pre>
Dear List,

I am looking for a reliable XML parser that works well in LispWorks.
I have had considerable trouble with many of the so-called "open"
implementations, particularly the stuff from Franz, it boggles my
mind that "open" code can use so many proprietary extensions to the
language/libraries.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Vincent

Hi,

When I use XML to establish interaction between parts of my programs 
written in different languages (such as Python and Lisp), I use S-XML 
on the Lisp side, which I slightly extended and optimized, but don't 
quite understand who to send the patches to.

When I need to read foreign XML in compliance with 
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml and http://www.w3.org/REC-xml-names, I 
first use another language to turn it into a format I can read easily 
(such as XML that S-XML understands).

There is also CL-XML, http://pws.prserv.net/James.Anderson/XML/, which 
is somewhat hard to put together and slower than I need it to be but 
almost conforming. It is also relatively big.

David

Well, you could use S-XML, http://common-lisp.net/project/s-xml
It is a small, simple, non-validating parser with both SAX and DOM  
style interfaces.
It has been around for some years and is being used in a number of  
other open-source projects.
Many people contributed to it. Namespace support was recently added.
It is good enough for a large number of XML applications, but it  
might fall short for some more complicated tasks.

&lt;/self-promotion&gt
