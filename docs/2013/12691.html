                <h1>Browser version in browser-pane</h1>
                <pre>
Hi,

When using the browser-pane on LWW, does anyone know what underlying Windows component is used?

On my Windows 7 machine, I have IE10 installed. Going to http://www.mybrowserinfo.com/ displays

"Your Browser User Agent String is Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/6.0)"

However when I use the browser-pane to display the same web page, it says

"Your Browser User Agent String is Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/6.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E)"


Apparently the browser-pane is using an older version of IE (that cannot display HTML5 video, which is my actual problem). I suspect that nothing can be done to change this from within LispWorks, as the browser is probably delivered as an opaque object. But it would still be interesting to know what component is being used, maybe there are some functions that can be called via FLI to manipulate the browser.

All input welcome!

Best regards
Erik

It uses whatever version of Internet Explorer is installed. In Windows
7, that can mean IE from 8 (vanilla) up to 11 (current latest).

When used as a COM/OLE object, the WebBrowser component runs in
compatibility mode with IE7 (or EmulateIE7, or something, check it out
at the MSDN IEBlog).

You can easily tell it to run in another mode using a DOCTYPE before
the HTML content, or with a META tag with http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible"
(again, check out the IEBlog, I remember there was even a diagram
explaining how IE9 determines the mode it should use).

Best regards,

Paulo Madeira

Allow me to revive an old thread:

In addition to Paulo Madeira's answer I just found out there's a way
to force CAPI:BROWSER-PANE to emulate a specific version of MSIE even
if you can't control the HTML content.  I think this wasn't mentioned
here yet:

Use the registry, for example like so:

  [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet
Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION]
  "lispworks-6-1-0-x86-win32.exe"=dword:11000

For a delivered executable or a saved image you'll have to use a
different name, of course.  "11000" would be the value for MSIE 11.
Other possible values can be found here:

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee330730%28v=vs.85%29.aspx#browser_emulation

Cheers,
Edi.
