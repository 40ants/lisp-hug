                <h1>Converting a file to a bit-vector?</h1>
                <pre>
I have a disk file and I'd like to load it into a bit vector of a
particular length, which might be less than (* file-octet-count 8), and
I might want to start from a non-zero offset (though aligning to octets
is a restriction with which I can live). I know how to do this in a
portable, leisurely way. Is there a supported, LispWorks-specific way to
do this quickly?

Thanks,
Zach

&gt
&gt I'm sure you've done or thought of doing the latter already.

A quick experiment suggests that LispWorks does not support
read-sequence for bit vectors.

&gt
&gt It looks to me as if it probably does but it doesn't support reading
&gt BITs from files, which makes the point moot really (ie when I tried
&gt this I get an error from READ-SEQUENCE when it tries to store
&gt something bigger than a BIT into the first element of the array).
&gt
&gt I am not sure what (open ... :element-type 'bit) is meant to do: for
&gt both the implementations I tried (LW and CCL) it seems to create a
&gt stream which reads 8-bit bytes, which strikes me as wrong (I'd want an
&gt error or a bit) but probably I am misreading the spec, since they both
&gt do this.

Well, the point is that it's implementation specific how binary elements
are stored into binary files (and therefore how they're read back).

What the standard says is that:

(let ((word (1+ (random 100)))                           ; no limit really
      (bits #(0 1 1 1 0 1)))
  (when (nth-value 1 (subtypep `(unsigned-byte ,word) `integer))
    (with-open-file (out "TEST.BIN" 
                         :element-type `(unsigned-byte ,word)
                         :direction :output
                         :if-does-not-exist :create
                         :if-exists :supersede)
      (write-sequence bits  out))
    (with-open-file (inp "TEST.BIN" 
                         :element-type `(unsigned-byte ,word)
                         :direction :input)
      (let ((v (make-array (file-length inp) :element-type `(unsigned-byte ,word))))
        (read-sequence v inp)
        (assert (= (file-length inp) (length bits))
                () "file length=~S expected=~S" (file-length inp) (length bits))
        (assert (equalp bits v)
                () "bits=~S read=~S" bits v)))))


For BITs, some implementation indeed write #(0 1 1 1 0 1) as (od -t x1):

0000000 00 01 01 01 00 01
0000006

while clisp packs bits (and bytes), but apart from when the byte size is
the same as the underlying file system byte size, this will require a
header specifying the file size (actually, just the number of bytes in
the last word):

0000000 06 00 00 00 2e
0000005




&gt Related to this is the question of bit-order: if you *could* read bits
&gt from a file what order do you want the bits in a byte in?

It's a concern for the implementation, if you use the BIT type.



Now, it is expected that (unsigned-byte 8) will map octet-by-octet the
contents of the file (on POSIX systems) to the octet vector.  You can
then do whatever bit decoding you want, in whatever bit order or bytesex
you want.  Of course, it wouldn't work to read 9-track magnetic tapes
on a 36-bit host.

That's a good point, and may be suitable in my current case after
all. In another case, I really do need bit vectors because bit-and,
bit-or, etc can be way, way, way faster than doing the logical bit
operators on octet vectors.
