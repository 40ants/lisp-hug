                <h1>Some CAPI demos</h1>
                <pre>
Happy New Year everybody!

In the last year, I've written (in Lisp, of course) quite a few small
demos for my students.  None of them is in any way new or spectacular
(although I like the Mandelbrot one quite a bit), but they are all
full-blown delivered executables (most of them for Windows, Linux, and
Mac OS) showing a variety of CAPI features.  So I thought I'd upload
some of them to my website in case someone wants to have a look at
them.  Here are the first four:

  http://weitz.de/mandelbrot/
  http://weitz.de/aco/
  http://weitz.de/hanoi/
  http://weitz.de/turing/

They haven't seen much testing yet, so if you come across something
that's fishy or doesn't work as advertised, I'd be happy if you could
send me a short email.

The upshot in terms of Lisp evangelism has been quite good, BTW.  Most
of the students have only been exposed to Java and scripting languages
so far and there are always some who express an immediate interest in
learning more about CL.

More to come... :)

Cheers,
Edi.

My apologies for the noise, but I managed to introduce a typical
last-minute error.  I've just uploaded a new version.  If your mouse
is over the EXE file it should now identify itself as having version
0.1.1.0.

Sorry,
Edi.

I've added a Linux version of the Mandelbrot set explorer.  It
definitely needs some testing!  (I only have a pretty old Linux
machine available and have to test CAPI apps via X.  Not much fun...)

Cheers,
Edi.

Oooh, that's bad.  I could only test on OS X 10.4 so far.  I'll see if
I can lure my wife away from her Mac so that I can test there.

Thanks for the heads-up,
Edi.

So, I can now confirm after tests on several different Macs that the
application works fine on 10.4 (two different machines) and does not
work at all on 10.6 or higher.  Unfortunately, I neither have an idea
what the problem could be nor do I have a Mac with something newer
than 10.4.  I think I'll just retract the Mac version for now.

Mikel Evins was nice enough to send me a backtrace from a current
version of OS X and it seems I was able to solve this problem.  The
new version doesn't show this strange crash-on-first-click behavior
anymore and was tested on 10.4 and 10.6 (here at home), 10.7.5 (Mikel)
and 10.8.2 (thanks to Hans Hübner).  So I hope it's OK if I pester the
list once again with a Mac version:

  http://weitz.de/mandelbrot/

And don't shoot me if it still doesn't work for you... :)

Thanks,
Edi.

Sometimes it seems to freeze up on the first click, other times it
works fine.  No support for Retina display (so everything appears
pixel-doubled).  Otherwise, very nice.  Sources?

No idea.  I click and get a white box, then it's totally unresponsive.

Well, mine was cheaper than the equivalent machine with a regular display....

That's an excellent question for the LW people.  I don't have LW for Mac.

I'm just curious about the algorithms you've used.  Back in the early
90s I spent some time 'brotting on a SPARCstation, pimping cycles out
of the inner loop and looking at the various tweaks known (which I
recall being variations on flood-filling).  This takes me back.

A while ago, I wrote the mail below.  In the meantime I've added a
couple more demos (including one that I just hacked together last
week).  Here they are:

  http://weitz.de/polygons/
  http://weitz.de/lindenmayer/
  http://weitz.de/morph/
  http://weitz.de/gauss/

As always, I'm interested in bug reports (which you probably shouldn't
bother the whole list with).

Thanks,
Edi.
