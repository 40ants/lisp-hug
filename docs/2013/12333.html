                <h1>Rendering images asynchronously</h1>
                <pre>
Hello List,

I need to generate a bunch of thumbnails, and since it takes some time, I would like to do it in another process, so that the GUI is not blocked while they are generated. I'm using GP to draw the images, which means that the image objects used for the thumbnails need a CAPI pane to be initialized. And the CAPI pane needs to be accessed in the correct process, which on MacOSX is the Cocoa Event Loop, i.e. the GUI process.

As far as I can tell, this makes it impossible to render images "in the background" using GP (at least on Cocoa, on Windows, it would probably be possible to display a dummy interface in its own process and using that to create the image objects).

Is there any way around this? (Of course I could use some external graphics library instead of GP, but it's not a very attractive solution)

Regards
Erik

Take a look at gp:pixmap-port to see if it suits your needs.

Thanks! Well, yes, I am using that already. But it seems that it leaks memory if run in a different process than the pane it was created with, which suggests that it should be run with apply-in-pane-process.<br>

Or am I wrong? In that case I need to find the correct way to do it!<br>

Since you are drawing multiple things to a port in order to generate your thumbnail, then yes, that part does need to take place in the pane&#39;s process. I thought that perhaps you were doing something different.</div>
<div style><br></div><div style>At this point, my only suggestions (others may have better options) would be one of the following:</div><div style><br></div><div style>1. Have a thumbnail generation queue that is periodically processed to continuously generate the thumbnails from within the pane process. Each entry in the queue would likely either some data used to draw the next piece of a thumbnail (the pixmap port and the operation) or just a closure that does it.</div>
<div style><br></div><div style>Pseudo code:</div><div style><br></div><div style>(defvar *thumbnail-queue*)</div><div style><br></div><div style>(defun insert-thumbnail-operation (function)</div><div style>  (enqueue *thumbnail-queue* function))</div>
<div style><br></div><div style>(defun process-thumbnail-queue (pane)</div><div style>  (apply-in-pane-process pane</div><div style>    (loop for a few milliseconds...</div><div style>      (let ((op (dequeue *thumbnail-queue*)))</div>
<div style>        (funcall op)))))</div><div style><br></div><div style>(defun create-example-thumbnail (pane port)</div><div style>  (insert-thumbnail-operation #&#39;(lambda () (gp:draw-line port 0 0 100 100)))</div>  (insert-thumbnail-operation #&#39;(lambda () (gp:draw-circle port 50 50 10)))<div style>
  (insert-thumbnail-operation #&#39;(lambda () (notify-pane-thumbnail-complete pane port))))</div><div style><br></div><div style>I&#39;m not sure if this solution will have issues with GP state changes (e.g. setting the color or thickness of the line you&#39;d like to draw). But most GP function calls allow you to pass those options as keywords instead of modifying the global state before the call.</div>
<div style><br></div><div style>2. Use something other than LispWorks to generate the thumbnails. For example, you can wrap ImageMagick (<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">http://www.imagemagick.org/</a>) use FLI and use similar functions for the operations you want, but just in another thread. Then convert the ImageMagick, in-memory image to a pixmap-port when done (I don&#39;t know how to do this, but I&#39;m sure others here have done it).. This likely requires a higher up-front cost in creating the FLI wrappers if someone else here hasn&#39;t already done it.</div>

<div><br></div><div>So what I&#39;m interested in is the generation of the in-memory pixmap images, which is also what takes time. And the source is not a big image, but rather a quite long list of objects that draw themselves to a port using different gp instructions (draw-line, draw-string etc). So it would not be an easy task to separate the drawing logic (which supposedly takes more time) from the drawing instructions (supposedly taking less time).</div>
<div><br></div><div>But the core problem is that I cannot generate the in-memory images in another thread than the interface&#39;s thread (which on MacOSX is the Cocoa Event Loop), and this is because the pixmap-port needs to be attached to a pane, and therefore also needs to be accessed in that pane&#39;s process.</div>
