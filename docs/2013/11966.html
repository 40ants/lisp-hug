                <h1>Suppressing the arithmetic-error condition</h1>
                <pre>
Hello All!

Is there a way to suppress signaling the arithmetic-error conditions 
such as division-by-zero or floating-point-overflow during the extensive 
numeric calculations?

I know that it is possible to handle the conditions with help of the 
handler-case form but it is too slow in my particular scenario as I have 
to divide the computation into many pieces.

It doesn't conform to the ANSI standard but I would like the following 
code return either 1d+-0 (nan) or -1d++0 (-infinity):

cl-user &gt (log (/ 1 1d++0))
Error: Arithmetic error in LOG of (0.0D0): Argument must not be zero.

For example, Scala returns -Infinity in this case:

scala&gt math.log(1 / Double.PositiveInfinity)
res1: Double = -Infinity

It seems there are flags in some CL implementations to control this 
behaviour, although I'm not quite sure. Is there something similar for 
LispWorks?

Thanks,
David

In the course of discussing it with Ala'a Mohammad, I arrived at a 
conclusion that the current behavior of LW is rather good. In other 
cases I indeed get either NaN or infinity as I need. Probably, the 
number of cases, when the division-by-zero condition is raised, is not 
so great. At least, it is better to have a signal than an incorrect 
result as in case of Scala:

scala&gt math.log (1 / Double.NegativeInfinity)
res0: Double = -Infinity

while the limit (= lim_{x -&gt -0}{log(x)}) doesn't even exist (but 
constants -0 and +0 would help to find a correct answer).

I think this is a difficult subject.

Thanks,
David
