Hello!

I've started testing the next release of our PrimeTrader application on
Windows 8, and have encountered a problem: After a while, some windows
stop updating their contents (or at lest the pinboard-layouts in them
stop redrawing themselves). It doesn't appear to help trying to perform
gestures in the window (e.g. clicking on objects which should have
highlighted them) or apply the menu-items (the menus themselves still
react to the mouse), but if I resize the window, it awakes immediately
and starts updating normally (and reacts to the gestures I tried to do
before "waking it up").

Now this Win 8 Pro installation runs under VMWare Fusion 5.0.3 on my
mac, and it only seems to happen when the Fusion full screen window has
been inactive for a while and I reactivate it as the active workspace in
OS X, so it might also be a Fusion problem. Still, it would be
interesting to hear if anyone have similar problems with LW 6.1 on
Windows 8!
