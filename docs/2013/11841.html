&gt What I would like to know is what happens when your source code text goes
&gt through a tool that likes to throw away all the leading spaces and
&gt substitute its own notion of tabs?

Throw away the god-awful tool?  Anything that messes with my source
code without my explicit permission goes in the bit-bucket.

While you're at it, put triggers in your SCM that will reject any
source code containing a tab character.  Tab characters are just plain
evil.  Inserting a tab character into code is a misdemeanour, maybe
excusable, when committed by an apprentice.  For anyone more senior
than that it should be a firing matter.

Certainly Python is not a lisp.  Was somebody suggesting that it is?
It does feel a bit lispy, though, when programming.  I have
experimented with a Python-like expression language before, and I
think it's a shame that there isn't a good one in widespread use (I
think that almost all programming languages would be improved by
transformation into expression languages).

Python has had proper closures and hence a usable lambda since Python
2 (I guess that's about a decade now), and despite occasional rumours
of its demise - GvR apparently doesn't like it, and so there was some
risk of losing it in the 2/3 transition - it seems that there are
enough functional thinkers in the Python community to ensure its
survival.

&gt They also think that changing the syntax &amp; semantics of the language

&gt principle to feed my tigers only with people who do that: they eat well.

I won't be drawn into a flame war on this, but I'd be interested to
see examples (and in particular any basis for the statement that "They
.... think that ... is just fine".  We were affected by a change to
integer division semantics many years ago, but generally Python seems
far better at this than the other languages of its generation (i.e.
Perl, PHP, Ruby, etc).  I think that immature language communities
should be excused a small amount of this (after all, bits of Lisp 1.5
wouldn't work very well on CL implementations).  Note that Python 3 is
a different language to Python 2, and although this is a problem it is
a different sort of problem.

try this hack (note that I'm advising an internal function):

(defadvice (editor::write-da-file before-write-da-file :before)
    (buffer pathname)
  (let* ((original-point (editor:copy-point (editor:buffer-point buffer))))
    (editor:buffer-start (editor:buffer-point buffer))
    (editor:replace-string-command nil (string #\tab) "    xXxXxX   ")
    (editor:move-point (editor:buffer-point buffer) original-point)))

do not forget to replace the xXxX.. pattern with your spaces preference.
