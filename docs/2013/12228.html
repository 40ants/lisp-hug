                <h1>Mouse cursors</h1>
                <pre>
Hi!

Are there predefined mouse cursors for two two-headed diagonal sizing 
cursors (1) northeast/southwest and (2) northwest/southeast? For 
example, in .NET they are known as Cursors.SizeNESW and 
Cursors.SizeNWSE. There are similar cursors in Java SWT too.

In LW there are cursors defined by keywords :top-right-corner and 
:bottom-left-corner and they look on Windows with the default settings 
precisely like the first mentioned cursor (1) as well as there are 
:top-left-corner and :bottom-right-corner that look like the other (2). 
In Linux they look differently. It will be enough for me if they will 
always look so in Windows. Is there such a guarantee?

Thanks,
David

You could probably try to run your application in different virtual  
machines to see if that is the case.

For example, if you run w7, you could install XPMode (a Windows XP virtual  
machine which comes with w7 for free) and run your application inside it  
on the personal edition of Lispworks.
