I haven't done a lot with CAPI in the past, and now making my first 
(real) app using it, I'm running into (what should be simple) issues I'm
 hoping a couple people here might be able to assist with.<br>
  <br>
I have a subclass of row-layout that is going to be added to a 
column-layout. It looks like this:<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-family: monospace;">+------------+<br>
| +--+-----+ |<br>
| |&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | |<br>
| +--+-----+ |<br>
|</span><span><span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |<br>
| +--+-----+ |<br>
| |&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | |<br>
| +--+-----+ |<br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">+------------+<br>
      <br>
    </span><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Now, I'd like 
something to happen whenever the user clicks on a row item in the column
 layout. I don't want to have to try and put the same callback handler 
in every child element of the row-layout instead of just having a single
 handler at the row-layout level. However, I can't seem to see any way 
of adding any input callbacks to the row-layout. Is this possible? Also,
 I'm assuming that by *not* having input callbacks in the child elements
 that they won't eat the message before the layout gets a crack at it. 
Is this a valid assumption or would I need to do more?<br>
      <br>
Next, I have a background thread that's actually accumulating the data 
that will be used to create each of the rows. As each item is collected 
it's added to an mp:mailbox object. I currently have a function (running
 in another thread) that loops until the mailbox is empty and creates 
each of the items, pushing it into the description of the column-layout.<br>
      <br>
    </span><span style="font-family: monospace;">(defun update-rows (mb 
pane)<br>
&nbsp; (with-slots (all-rows)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pane<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (flet ((make-row ()<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (let* ((item (mailbox-read mb))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (row (make-instance 'row-layout ...)))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (push row (layout-description column-layout)))))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; (loop<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; :until (mailbox-empty-p mb)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; :do (apply-in-pane-process pane #'make-row))))</span><span 
style="font-family: sans-serif;">)<br>
      <br>
If there are even a few items in the mailbox, this totally locks 
up/crashes the IDE on OS X. On Windows (for which I only have the 
personal edition to work with) the heap quickly fills and the IDE 
closes, which doesn't make sense given how dead simple the interface I'm
 building is.<br>
      <br>
If I take out the loop and do an (unless empty make-row) form, it works 
(on both platforms) and I can repeatedly call this function myself over 
and over with no problems. Can anyone see something obvious that I'm 
just doing wrong here?<br>
      <br>
As a work-around, if I do (apply-in-pane-process ... #'update-rows), 
then everything is fine, but if there are a large number of rows to be 
added then the interface is essentially frozen while it adds them, which
 is what I wanted to avoid.<br>
      <br>
Thanks for any replies/insights!<br>
