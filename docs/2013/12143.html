                 <h1>Re: Old tricks now formalized?</h1>
                 <pre>
Hello:

Just a note on generators. I implemented my own generators in Lisp,
but did not resort to fancy tricks. The only negative is that we don't
get to use YIELD because, as you said, we don't have built-in
continuations (and I'd rather not haul in a library for doing CPS
transformation).

My technique was simple: just use closures, and signal a particular
condition if/when the generator is exhausted.

For example:

;; Take 5 elements from the FIBS generator.
CL-USER&gt (take 5 (fibs))
(0 1 1 2 3)

;; Square each natural number (MAP)
CL-USER&gt (map-generator (lambda (x) (* x x))
                        (up-from 0))
#&lt;GENERATOR {1006B6BB63}&gt

;; And then accumulate them (FOLD)
CL-USER&gt (accumulator (lambda (x y) (+ x y))
                      0
                      *)
#&lt;GENERATOR {1006CE1853}&gt

;; What are the first three accumulations of the list of squares?
;; They should be 0, 0+0^2, 0+0^2+1^2
CL-USER&gt (list (next *) (next *) (next *))
(0 0 1)

;; Compute the next even accumulation.
CL-USER&gt (next-if #'evenp **)
14

;; Collect the next 50.
CL-USER&gt (take 50 ***)
(30 55 91 140 204 285 385 506 650 819 1015 1240 1496 1785 2109 2470 2870 3311
 3795 4324 4900 5525 6201 6930 7714 8555 9455 10416 11440 12529 13685 14910
 16206 17575 19019 20540 22140 23821 25585 27434 29370 31395 33511 35720 38024
 40425 42925 45526 48230 51039)

So that is how they are used, but how are they implemented? Well, we
resort to a rather low-level closure where we record state. For
example, for FIBS:

(defun fibs ()
  "Create a new generator for Fibonacci numbers."
  (generator
   (let ((x 0)
         (y 1))
     (lambda ()
       (prog1 x
         (psetq x y
                y (+ x y)))))))

I particularly don't mind this style, and I think the compositional
benefits of generators is worth creating these kinds of closures, but
I do admit that it is somewhat difficult to encapsulate the "current
state" of a generator easily.

You can find all of the code for these here:
http://tinyurl.com/bzeluja (points to
https://bitbucket.org/tarballs_are_good/lisp-random/src/3db634111d35e788c6ea2f4a1b3ab38334e24cde/generators.lisp?at=default
). Other examples from there include finite generators, generators for
the lines of a file (useful if you don't want to read in a file all at
once, and don't want to have an explicit READ-LINE loop), and some
functional "transducers" (map, reduce, filter).

Cheers,

Robert Smith
