Hello, LispWorks community...<br>
  <br>
I've been using LispWorks for a bunch of personal projects for a while 
now. All my projects are typically internet-based. Over time I've been 
building up a bunch of packages that I thought I'd share! I've found 
LispWorks (out of the box) to be lacking when it comes to doing work on 
the internet, so hopefully new-comers will find this and be able to 
start using it right away.<br>
  <br>
Anyway, I'm posting a bunch of packages here that I've put up on GitHub.
 They are all licensed under Apache 2.0, so feel free to use them, fork 
them, etc. All the code is 100% Lisp. There is no use of FLI, DLL 
requirements, or code from anyone else (aside from what comes with 
LispWorks standard).<br>
  <br>
Definitely email me if you have questions, find a bug, or have a feature
 request. I certainly have my own feature list of things to continue 
doing, but knowing others use/need them as well will get my creative 
juices flowing more....<br>
  <br>
Enjoy!<br>
  <br>
1. <span><a href="https://github.com/massung/pl">https://github.com/massung/pl</a>

  <br>
This is my "package-loader" source. It handles feature requirements, 
dependency packages, and implementation-specific module requirements. I 
dislike ASDF and Quicklisp, so this is what I made. It's really designed
 to be used in conjunction with Git. You don't have to, but all other 
packages listed here are setup to use this and it helps.<br>
  <br>
2. <span><a href="https://github.com/massung/re">https://github.com/massung/re</a>
 <br>
    <br>
This is a Lua-style pattern matching library. It's *very* fast. Most 
things I list here will use it in one way or another. If you use nothing
 else, I've found this incredibly useful overall.<br>
    <br>
3. </span><span><a href="https://github.com/massung/lexer">https://github.com/massung/lexer</a>
 <br>
    <br>
This is a tokenizer that uses the "re" package above. While it can be 
used alone, it's made to be used with the LispWorks "parsergen" module. <br>
    <br>
4. </span><span><a href="https://github.com/massung/json">https://github.com/massung/json</a>
 <br>
    <br>
A JSON decoder and encoder package that uses the "lexer" package. It's 
incredibly small and simple.<br>
    <br>
5. </span><span><a href="https://github.com/massung/xml">https://github.com/massung/xml</a>
 <br>
    <br>
An XML parser. It handles almost everything in XML (namespaces, 
doctypes, entities, stylesheets, cdata, comments, etc). It supports 
querying as well. It is *not* an XML writer, though.<br>
    <br>
6. </span><span><a href="https://github.com/massung/date">https://github.com/massung/date</a>
 <br>
    <br>
An RFC822 and RFC3339 internet date format encoder and decoder. It's 
pretty strict and adheres to the RFCs for each, though. This one is 
fairly new, so if you find a bug (likely dealing with time zones), 
please let me know.<br>
    <br>
7. </span><span><a href="https://github.com/massung/rss">https://github.com/massung/base64</a><br>
    <br>
A really simple base64 encoder and decoder. Nothing much that's special 
here.<br>
    <br>
8. </span><span><a href="https://github.com/massung/http">https://github.com/massung/http</a><br>
    <br>
A complete HTTP client and URL parsing package. URL parsing is complete 
(scheme, auth, domain, port, path, query, fragment).&nbsp; Has a bunch of 
utility functions for query string parsing and creation. URL 
encoding/decoding, formatting URLs, header parsing, etc. Correctly 
handles HEAD, GET, DELETE, PUT, POST, and PATCH requests. Correctly uses
 SSL when required. Has functionality for following redirects. It also 
handles chunked transfer encoding. There's still more I want to do with 
this package, like handling gzip content encoding, but it passes almost 
every test at </span><span><a href="http://httpbin.org/">http://httpbin.org/</a>
 (the two it doesn't is /gzip and /redirect, because httpbin uses a 
relative path redirect which is against the HTTP spec).<br>

<meta content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1" http-equiv="Content-Type">
</head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" text="#000000">After some very positive 
feedback (much appreciated), I decided to get rid of my unique (and 
dead-simple) package-loader package and switch to ASDF since it's 
ubiquitous and LispWorks now comes with it built-in.<br>
<br>
However, I'm hoping someone can help me with something regarding ASDF 
(since I've not been a big user). In my .lispworks file I have this:<br>
<br>
;;;; set where ASDF looks for systems<br>
(flet ((asd-directory (file)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (make-pathname :directory (pathname-directory file))))<br>
&nbsp; (let ((asd-files (directory #p"~/Projects/*/*.asd")))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (setf asdf:*central-registry* (mapcar #'asd-directory asd-files))))<br>
<br>
This seems quite obnoxious. Does ASDF have a way of setting a 
"top-level" directory and having it search sub-directories for ASD 
system files?<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
<br>
