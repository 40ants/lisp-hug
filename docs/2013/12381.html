                <h1>Tracing Through Modules</h1>
                <pre>
Hello, all

Is there a way to trace through a module I'm trying to REQUIRE or load via ASDF, directly, without having to try to split the system that I'm trying to REQUIRE or load via (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op &lt;systemname&gt) back apart and attempt to trace through it manually? Or, is there a way to take a source file I'm loading with (load "lisp-source-file-name") and see exactly / pedantically what's being loaded and what forms are being eval'd, if any? I'd like to avoid having to copy and paste code into the REPL window if it's at all possible. Plus, that method is preventing my seeing what's being evaluated, when.

Even if I can't see the code directly, I'd be more than happy with some sort of representation of what was supposed to be loading - say, a diagram, showing what my main .lisp file was requiring, and what was going to happen / become defined / be evaluated when any given module was being REQUIREd.

Apologies if I'm missing something dead-obvious here. And, if anyone has any suggestions / advice for troubleshooting modules / systems, I'd be grateful.

Thanks,
Larry Morley
