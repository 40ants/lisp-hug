                <h1>Return/Enter in dialogs</h1>
                <pre>
Hi folks,

Usually it is possible to dismiss dialogs by pressing Return or Enter (for OK) or Escape (for cancel). However if I make a CAPI dialog with a text-input-pane, that pane's callback would be called when pressing Enter, and the dialog won't close until I hit Enter a second time. Of course, I can set :callback of the text-input-pane, but it can be a tedious work if there are many dialogs, and furthermore, that approach won't work at all for e.g. a multi-column-list-panel, which lacks a callback slot.

So, my questions are

1) Is it possible to have a general dispatch of the Enter/Return key in a dialog, so that it *always* emulates the button marked with :default-p?

2) Is it possible to catch the Return/Enter key in a multi-column-list-panel, and other panes lacking such a callback?

Regards
Erik

In my experience, :default-p usually works on Windows if the callback is not
specified for the pane and there is a visible pane with focus.

Some panes also have :action-callback.
Some intercept and muffle pressing the Return/Enter or Escape key.
For an output pane, the corresponding gestures should be specified by means
of the input model.

Subclass text-input-pane with a variant that defaults to what you want, 
then use it everywhere instead of text-input-pane.

Have a look at alternative-action-callback.lisp example.  It appears to 
accept RETURN's.
