                <h1>ASDF and FASL files concatenation</h1>
                <pre>
Hi,

I would like to implement ASDF's CONCATENATE-SYSTEM operation similar
to LW:CONCATENATE-SYSTEM. I tried to use Piter Seibel's
ASDF-EXTENSIONS:BUILD-ONE-FASL as an example and it works fine with
SBCL but doesn't with LispWorks. Currently BUILD-ONE-FASL just
concatenates all FASL files of a given system into one bigger file and
SBCL then can LOAD it all. LispWorks can LOAD only the first FASL and
ignores the rest of the concatenated FASL file. I compared the output
with LW:CONCATENATE-SYSTEM and it looks like each FASL of the
concatenated FASL file is prepended with some extra information.

Has anyone done this before in LispWorks?

Thanks.

Don't know if that may be helpful, but if you look here

  http://weitz.de/lw-add-ons/#asdf

you'll find somewhere in the source some code which translates many
(of course not all) ASDF system definitions into LW DEFSYSTEM
definitions.  Perhaps you could do something like this as a workaround
and the use CONCATENATE-SYSTEM?

Cheers,
Edi.

I believe that the must recent version of ASDF support concatenate system out of the box...

HTH,
