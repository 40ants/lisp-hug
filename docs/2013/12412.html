                <h1>Profiling oddity</h1>
                <pre>
Hello,

I would like to profile a multi-processing application.

The application reads and writes data on the serial port using non-blocking I/O.  The serial port is accessed with a thin lisp wrapper around the read, write and select Posix calls.

When I launch DO-PROFILING, the serial port process stops because of an error while reading the file descriptor: "Resource temporary unavailable".  I have noticed that I get the same error when using the stepper.

So, if the Serial I/O process is disrupted with the profiler or the stepper, accessing the file descriptor ends with an error from the operating system.  However if I use the stepper with another process, the error does not occur, which would tend to highlight some affinity between the lisp scheduler and operating system I/O.

I would be curious if someone has an idea on what could cause this error and how to work around it?


Best regards,
Camille

I forgot to specify that this happens on Mac OS X.

OK, so I found the problem is in fact has nothing to do with LispWorks.  "Resource temporary unavailable" is EAGAIN, and must be dealt with when working with non-blocking I/O.  My process was stopping because of this unhanded error.

Now, I still wonder why the profiler happens to cause this error, since the processing is interrupted for so long.  I will try with different settings.

Sorry for the noise!
