Thomas, in your case something like

(dspec:define-dspec-alias define-test (x) `(defun ,x))

might help.

Dspec machinery gives only a coarse control, it allows to find top-level form
only, AFAIK. This is, definitely, better than nothing.

"Debugger Edit" command uses additional (undocumented) machinery to find exact
location of a error inside of toplevel form.

&gt I see that my response didn't really address the issue that you were raising.
Now that I understand it, this is actually a problem with define-test in
lisp-unit. It is not possible to go to source when there is an error in an
assertion. While annoying, I've had bigger issues to address and have just let
this slide.
&gt
&gt
&gt Isn't this problem addressed in LispWorks by Dspecs: Tools for Handling
Definitions?
