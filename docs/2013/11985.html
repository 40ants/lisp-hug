                <h1>Drawing in the background and multiple threads</h1>
                <pre>
I'm of course aware that CAPI operations should always use
apply-in-pane-process or execute-with-interface in order to make sure
that things happen in the right thread.  However, the user guide only
says that "all operations on DISPLAYED CAPI elements need to be in the
thread that runs their interface."  (Emphasis mine.)

Am I right to assume that if I'm for example drawing to an output pane
which is NOT displayed and only used as a background buffer that I can
draw to it from whichever thread I like, presumably from several
threads at the same time?  Does anybody have experience with such an
approach?

Thanks,
Edi.

Hi Edi, et al,

That is what I do in our GigaDSP that you have seen demoed in Hamburg. I use backing stores and manage that myself. CAPI is completely unaware that I'm doing such things. I do use GP (Graphic Ports) during these operations.

Just my 2 cents…  I have never done such thing, but I am wondering if it wouldn't be needed to at least serialize access to the graphics-state, unless there is one graphics-state for each thread.


Best,
Cam

David, Camille,

Thanks to you both.  I wasn't planning to manipulate the Graphics
State, so that won't be a problem.  Otherwise, it's good to hear that
you're also doing this and that it works.

Cheers,
Edi.

If my program does nothing but drawing lines, all in the same color,
it doesn't manipulate the Graphics State, or does it?  It has to draw
a lot of small line segments, but nothing else - no transformations,
no colors, etc.

It really IS some kind of "turtle graphics" that I'm working on.
Another one of those demos for the students... :)
