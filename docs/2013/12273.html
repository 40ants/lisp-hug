                <h1>capi interfaces as actors</h1>
                <pre>
I have a handful of capi interfaces and I need them to communicate 
through mp:mailboxes to each other, like GUI actors.

At present, I create a second process for each interface which runs the 
"actor" code and calls capi:apply-in-pane-process to update the interfaces.

Given that interfaces are themselves processes, can I do all of this 
without creating the second set of processes?

Most of the interfaces need to display themselves, then call 
mp:mailbox-wait-for-event on their mailbox.  I haven't figured out how 
to do this using only the interfaces' processes (it may very well be 
that I'm missing something obvious).  Any ideas would be welcome.

thanks
pt

Hello, This seems to be the flip side of the of "reactive" problem coin
I faced, and mentioned on here on Aug 30 2011, in
&lt;permalink.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.lispworks.general/11216&gt

I had wished for some way to hook in to the interface's process, a hook
that would get run at some point in the gui loop, where you could run
your code thunks here.  Would the availability of such a mechanism help
your problem?  [I still haven't solved that problem] --- Madhu
