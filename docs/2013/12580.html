                <h1>Reloading foreign libraries</h1>
                <pre>
Hello,

I am currently working on a connection between LW and an external C library. LispWork FLI and/or CFFI work pretty well for that, but I don't seem to be able to dynamically "unload" and reload the library (for instance if I change and recompile the lib, and want to connect the new functions to LW, without having to restart all).

Actually, it seems that FLI::disconnect-module (even with :remove T) has no effect: the symbols are still resolved and the foreign funcalls still work.

Does anyone have any experience or suggestion ?
Thank you,

Jean Bresson

I remember having a similar trouble, as far as I can recall, things were  
getting confused about passing the name and real-name arguments. In the  
end it worked if I supplied only the path to the library to both  
disconnect-module and register-module.

(setq path "c:/libs/lib.dll")

(fli:disconnect-module pathname :remove t)
(fli:register-module pathname)
