                <h1>Differing behavior w/ delivered app</h1>
                <pre>
LWM 6.1.1 w/ OS X Maverick..

I have a CAPI application that in the REPL works just fine. The main 
sticking point is that when the application is quit (via menu 
accelerator) it calls quit-interface. According to the documentation, 
this should call the destroy callback for the interface if one is set up.

In The REPL this callback is called, which allows me to write out some 
data to a file that has been modified while the application is running. 
In the delivered application, it would seem that the callback is called, 
because the file is "written" to, except that the file is completely 
wiped instead of being updated.

Does quit-interface not actually wait for the destroy callback to 
complete before nuking the process? Or perhaps there's a better place 
for me to put this code other than the destroy callback?

Thanks!

On Windows, I use the following destroy-callback for the main application window:

(defmethod interface-on-destroy progn ((face my-iface))
  (with-slots (grid) my-iface
    (when (loaded grid)
      (grid:save-preferences grid)
      (grid:grid-on-destroy grid)))
  (when (yl:delivery-level)
    (lw:quit)))

Here yl:delivery-level returns NIL when in REPL, e.g. in the LispWork IDE.

I also specify the following key argument to the deliver function:
  :quit-when-no-windows nil

What were the arguments to CL:OPEN?  --- can you show your
WITH-OPEN-FILE form?

[I've seen some behaviour that I didn't quite understand, from glibc/OS
  filesystem semantics, where the file is removed on error, or (as you
  are seeing) is truncated even when i expected a partial file to be
  written]

(This may be obvious, but I imagine you can always call the code
explicitly from the menu callback before calling QUIT-INTERFACE)
