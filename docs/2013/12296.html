                <pre>
Hello,

This may sound obvious, but I am wondering if I can safely assume that a processes'  cleanup forms are executed in this very process.

i.e. :

(defun my-process-cleanup (process)
  ;; is this always true?
  (eq process (mp:get-current-process))


I can't find the part of the documentation about processes cleanup forms.


Thanks in advance,
Cam

Sorry, I didn't read your message carefully. I don't know, but I
assume nothing in my cleanups. Some information can be found in
Lispworks User Guide and Reference Manual/MP Package.

I think it must be, or mp:current-process-in-cleanup-p would make no sense (or would be horribly misnamed, at least: it could return true in a cleanup form for a given process even if that form was actually executing in another process, I suppose, but that would be a bit mad given its name).

(Looking at the disassembly for it and mp:current-process leads me to believe this as well...)

Greetings to the List...

Has anyone received webcam streaming video from within LispWorks?

Are there any libraries that do that out there?  I have looked, but 
see nothing apparent.

The obvious approach is to surround the MicroSoft "DirectShow", which 
apparently does that sort of thing, with FLI wrappers and all that - 
but, Wikipedia says about DirectShow:  "It is regarded as one of 
Microsoft's most complex development libraries/APIs."...

There has to be a better way...

Thoughts?

ps - What I am looking to do is "simple": Display streaming webcam 
video in a CAPI pane - occasionally grab a frame and process it...

Hello Cam -

I appreciate the reply and suggestion.

My fundamental need is to bring the video into the Lisp Space in 
fairly hard real time and occasionally grab and process a frame.

This is part of the digital livescan fingerprinting system that 
Secure Outcomes has built in LispWorks. The video to come in will be 
from a USB webcam - not fingerprints.

The system already grabs real-time data from the fingerprint scan 
sensor device that runs at video rates and so I know that the 
bandwidth exists inside Lisp. However, in that case, the fingerprint 
scan hardware device driver is fairly simple to use and so that 
integration was not too horrible and did not require something as 
maniacal as the MicroSoft "DirectShow" appears to be.

Has anyone read streaming video into Lisp Space?

Hey Jack:

Getting video from a webcam in Windows would be quite easy if you
don't mind the resolution being limited to 640x480. (Remember that
only recently did we get these mega hi-def video streams. Lots of
camcorders still operate at that resolution or lower!)

It would require writing a small core using VFW (Video For Windows) in
C which captures the images and sends them to the Lisp space, where
they could get copied or whatever.

Specifically, you would do something roughly like this:

1. Initialize camera

2. Picture loop

    a. Grab a frame

    b. Copy the frame in the C side

    c. Send that pointer to the Lisp world.

    d. Process frame (paint it, save it, buffer it, whatever)

    e. Destroy it.

3. Uninitialize camera

4. Disconnect (in software) the camera.


There are a few gotchas with synchronization, but they're relatively simple.

I hope this helps.

Regards,

Robert

Thank You Cam for the suggestion - OpenCV looks quite interesting and 
also supports a straight C (or C++) interface, which would certainly 
simplify things a bit.

I appreciate the information and will keep the List informed of 
progress toward streaming real time video into Lisp Space.

Hello Robert -

I appreciate hearing from you.

We really need megapixel type streaming video from a high-end webcam 
such as the Logitech C920, which has up to 10-megapixel resolution; 
hardware pan/tilt/zoom (under software control) as well as autofocus 
- and Carl Zeiss/Germany glass optics.

The streaming rate is not very important - even as slow as a couple 
frames/second displayed on a CAPI pane would be fine.  The object 
that we are videoing/analyzing has a slow rate of movement.
