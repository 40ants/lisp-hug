                <h1>LispWorks mouse pointer on Linux</h1>
                <pre>
Hello All,

I think I may have mentioned this before, but the mouse pointer on Linux is an up arrow symbol. The other platforms have the standard mouse pointer, so I assume this is a bug. Someone suggested that I should try the Redhat distro, but it is the same on Redhat as well. I'm just wondering if y'all have seen this and whether there may be a patch that fixes it. It works, but it gets pretty annoying after a while.

Note: This only occurs when the preferences-&gtenvironment-&gtemulation is set to "Editor keys like KDE/Gnome".

Thanks,
Gerry

I would suggest you file a bug report for this.  The LispWorks team will be happy to save your request in their database so they can track it.

Hi Gerry,

The same here LinuxMint 15 32-bit, LWL Pro 6.1.1 32-bit. It only
happens when I hover on an editor/textarea component (others like
lists, and toolbars are okay)

Ala'a
