                <h1>Executing a command-line after call to deliver</h1>
                <pre>
Hi,

It seems deliver must be the last call in a delivery script.  I would like to call SYS:CALL-SYSTEM-SHOWING-OUTPUT just after delivery is complete, but I have not found how I can do that.  It seems the action list "Delivery Actions" is executed during the delivery process, is there a list for executing things after delivery is complete?

Thanks!
Cam

Replying to myself:

It seems the action list "When quitting image" works okay.  Oddly enough, it requires the function to be compiled in order to be properly  called from the action list after delivery is finished.

I fear the function it is saved within the image, in which case I will have to run the call outside of the delivery script, it's not a something I want to leave in the delivered image...
