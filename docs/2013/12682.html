	       ILC 2014 - International Lisp Conference
			  "Lisp on the Move"

     August 14-17 2014, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Canada

	      Sponsored by the Association of Lisp Users

	     http://www.international-lisp-conference.org


Scope:

Lisp is one of the greatest ideas from computer science and a major
influence for almost all programming languages and for all
sufficiently complex software applications.

The International Lisp Conference is a forum for the discussion of
Lisp and, in particular, the design, implementation and application of
any of the Lisp dialects.  We encourage everyone interested in Lisp to
participate.

We invite high quality submissions in all areas involving Lisp
dialects and any other languages in the Lisp family, including, but
not limited to, ACL2, AutoLisp, Clojure, Common Lisp, ECMAScript,
Dylan, Emacs Lisp, ISLISP, Racket, Scheme, SKILL, HOP etc.

This year's focus will be directed towards integrated solutions,
including mobile computing. We especially invite submissions in the
following areas:

  * Pervasive computing
  * Interoperability
  * Portability
  * Implementation challenges/tradeoffs for embedded/mobile platforms
  * Language support for mobile toolkits and frameworks
  * Language support for distribution
  * Language support for reliability, availability, and serviceability
  * Mobile IDEs
  * Mobile applications

Contributions are also welcome in other areas, including but not
limited to:

  * Language design and implementation
  * Language integration, inter-operation and deployment
  * Applications (especially commercial)
  * Reflection, meta-object protocols, meta-programming
  * Domain-specific languages
  * Programming paradigms and environments
  * Efficient parallel and concurrent computation
  * Language support for managing both manual and automatic GC
  * Theorem proving
  * Scientific computing
  * Data mining
  * Semantic web


Technical Programme:

Original submissions in all areas related to the conference themes are
invited for the following categories:

  Papers: Technical papers of up to 10 pages that describe original
  results.

  Demonstrations: Abstracts of up to 2 pages for demonstrations of
  tools, libraries and applications.

  Workshops: Abstracts of up to 2 pages for groups of people who intend
  to work on a focused topic for half a day.

  Tutorials: Abstracts of up to 2 pages for in-depth presentations about
  topics of special interest for 1 to 2 hours.

  Panel discussions: Abstracts of up to 2 pages for discussions about
  current themes. Panel discussion proposals must mention panel member
  who are willing to partake in a discussion.

The conference will also provide slots for lightning talks, to be
registered on-site every day.

For inquiries about any other kind of participation (commercial
exhibits, advertising, prizes, book signing etc.), please see the
contacts below.

 - May    18, 2014: Submission deadline
 - June   09, 2014: Notification of acceptance
 - June   29, 2014: Final Papers due
