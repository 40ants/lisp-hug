                <h1>Problems with LWM 6.0 and "Mountain Lion"?</h1>
                <pre>
Hi!

I've been using LW to create demos at my university in the last year
(you've seen some of them) and I usually try to build versions for
Windows, Linux, and OS X.  Two of the programs that are heavily  used
by the students worked fine for everyone last year and now (although
unchanged) ceased to work for the Mac users.  It seems everyone who
has issues is using "Mountain Lion" (which I don't have so I can't
test myself).  One of the main problems is that text input panes no
longer work as usual.

I've been using LWM 6.0 to create these programs (I don't have a newer
version of LWM) and my OS X is ancient - 10.4.x.  Are there any known
problems with LWM 6.0 and "Mountain Lion"?  Any known reason that LW
programs which used to work on previous OS X versions shouldn't work
anymore?

Thanks,
Edi.

I didn't get LW6 to work at all on my new laptop which came with
Mountain Lion 4 months ago, which was somewhat frustrating since I
hadn't moved to LW6.1 yet at that time.

So yes, there are definitely some issues.

(In addition to the fact that LW 6 seems to work poorly or not at all on
Mountain Lion, there's also the issue of gatekeeper requiring signed
applications. Fortunately, that's easily solved as long as you're a
registered Mac developer and have the right certificates.)

&gt
&gt This is easily solved by control-clicking the LispWorks app and
&gt choosing "Open" from the contextual menu. At the dialog box:

I know, but I still had issues, and eventually gave up.

(The gatekeeper comment was mainly a reminder that you may want to sign
distributed delivered executables)

On the other hand - come to think of it - I haven't had any reports at
all that customers have problems running PrimeTrader on Mountain
Lion. It also works fine on my laptop. So while I didn't get LW 6 to
work, my own builds done with LW 6 seem to work fine. 

And I just had a look at which version of PrimeTrader customers with
Mountain Lion are running, and a surprising number of them are even
running a 2010 edition of PrimeTrader built with LW 5.1.2!

Hi,

Please check the security settings of your Mac: System Preferences - Security &amp; Privacy - General - Allow applications downloaded from - Anywhere.

If this is set to "Mac App Store and identified developers" instead of "Anywhere," there may be problems, if I recall correctly.
