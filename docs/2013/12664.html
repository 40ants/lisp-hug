                <h1>Mac resource forks from Lispworks</h1>
                <pre>
In one of my forthcoming projects I'm going to want to be able to create buttons or other CAPI objects containing images obtained from the custom icons on Mac OSX directories. OSX uses a sort of bizarre hack to associate custom icons with folders for use by the Finder and other Mac apps--specifically, It creates an invisible empty file named "Icon^M" (that last character is a carriage return), and stores the icon data in the resource fork of the invisible file (resource forks are idiosyncratic to the Mac platform).

Now, Cocoa provides some straightforward tools with which to get at those icons, using NSWorkspace, but calling an Objective-C method to return an NSImage isn't necessarily the most convenient way to get an image that is easy to work with in Lisp. I can go that route if I have to, but does anyone know how I might persuade Lispworks to read the icons from the resource fork? There are pathname shenanigans you can perform with OSX tools to get at resource forks but, unsurprisingly, the Lispworks pathname implementation doesn't seem to know about them (not that it necessarily should...).

Hi Mikel,

I would suggest you try this:

(from Wikipedia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_fork)

&gt From the POSIX interface, the resource fork could be accessed as filename/..namedfork/rsrc […]


So I would guess that opening a stream to the special pathname would work.
Now, it is not exactly sure that you will like what you’ll see, I wouldn’t bet the icon data is merely encoded as standard encoding like PNG...


Best,
Cam

I already tried it; it didn't work.

I'll try it again just to make sure I didn't screw something up the first time.

The project in question needs to be able to look at an existing OSX system and display the same custom folder icons that the Finder would display. Those custom icons are stored in a resource fork (yes, still, in this day and age). That being the case, I have to be able to read those resource forks.

As I already mentioned, I know how to do that using Cocoa (I was a programmer at Apple in the 80s and 90s and am quite familiar with both resource forks and the historical context of their invention). I would prefer to do it in a more Lisp-friendly way if I can, and I was hoping someone else already had that figured out.

&gt I would advise that you abstract the system interfaces away (ie NSWorkSpace). You can get the NSImage's decoded bytes and feed it into a gp:image that you will use in your LW application.
&gt 
&gt You can't guarantee in the future that Apple won't change the format of the icons or just drop support for resource forks in the future. For me this is private stuff.

Good point.

Mikel,

Perhaps I'm misunderstanding, but aren't all the application icons 
located in the Contents/Resources folder of the .app "file"? The 
filename of the icns file will be located in Contents/Info.plist under:

&lt;plist&gt
&lt;dict&gt
     ...
&lt;key&gtCFBundleIconFile&lt;/key&gt
&lt;string&gtapp.icns&lt;/string&gt
     ...
&lt;/dict&gt
&lt;/plist&gt

So, if you wanted to find the icns file reliably for any Mac OS X 
..app... (note: the code below uses my xml parsing library - available on 
github - but should give you the idea):

(defun icns-for-app (app)
   (when-let (pathname (probe-file app))
     (let* ((contents (merge-pathnames "Contents/" pathname))
            (resources (merge-pathnames "Resources/" contents))
            (plist-file (merge-pathnames "Info.plist" contents))
            (plist-doc (xml:parse-xml (lex:slurp plist-file)))
            (plist-dict (xml:query-xml plist-doc "/plist/dict" :first t))
            (key-values (xml:node-elements plist-dict)))
       (loop :for key := (pop key-values)
             :for value := (pop key-values)
             :while key
             :when (string= (xml:node-value key) "CFBundleIconFile")
             :return (let ((icns (pathname (xml:node-value value))))
                       (unless (pathname-type icns)
                         (setf icns (make-pathname :name (pathname-name 
icns) :type "icns")))
                       (merge-pathnames icns resources))))))

Sometimes the CFBundleIconFile is missing the .icns extension, so it's a 
good idea to check for it and add it on if missing.

CL-USER &gt (icns-for-app "/Applications/LispWorks 6.1/LispWorks.app")
#P"/Applications/LispWorks 6.1/LispWorks.app/Contents/Resources/app.icns"

CL-USER &gt (icns-for-app "/Applications/iMovie.app")
#P"/Applications/iMovie.app/Contents/Resources/iMovie.icns"

Is this what you are hoping to achieve?
