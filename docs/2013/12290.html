                <pre>
Hello,

I realized I was doing the same task every time I wanted to build a small or large application, command-line or CAPI based.  Based on the experience I gathered from this list, LispWorks examples and the reference manuals, I have created a small project generator that I hope will come useful.

    https://github.com/tuscland/lw-project-generator


Basically, creating a CAPI project with delivery and Git repository boils down to:

    (project-generator:run "COM.WILDORA.MY-APP" "My App")


I will be glad to receive your feedback and contributions, I'm sure there many dark corners not yet explored.

Please note that I have been not able to test this fully other than Mac OS X.  As an owner of LW for Windows, I will make sure in the future it works that platform too.

Thanks!


Best Regards,
Camille

Hello Camille:

I just wanted to let you know about the portable project generators
(so not LispWorks specific):

Quickproject by Zach Beane: https://github.com/xach/quickproject

CL-PROJECT by Eitarow Fukamachi: https://github.com/fukamachi/cl-project

None of these, of course, do anything with CAPI.

I will try to give yours a try soon and let you know.

Cheers,

Robert
