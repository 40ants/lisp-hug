                <h1>submenus in popup-menus?</h1>
                <pre>
Hi.  Ive got a hard time finding the errors im doing in some callbacks
assigned to a submenu of a 'contextual' menu (popup-menu, mouse-3,
right-click...).

There are 2 interfaces set up at the bottom, one with a standard menu w.
submenu - working as expected - and one using the same menu-elements in
a 2-level popup-menu - where the sub-menu elements dont work.

Any clues to whats going on is highly appreciated.

-anders


(defun showelem (data iface)
  (display-message "~A" (list data iface)))

(setq m1 (make-instance 'menu
			:items '("Red" "Blue" "Green")
			:callback 'showelem))

(setq m2 (make-instance 'menu
			:items (list 1 2 3 4 m1)
			:callback 'showelem))

(defun popup-test (pane x y)
  (capi:display-popup-menu
   (make-instance 'capi:menu
		  :items (list 1 2 3 4 m1)
		  :callback 'showelem)))

(define-interface test ()
  ()
  (:panes
   (viewer output-pane
	   :visible-min-height 100
	   :visible-min-width 100
	   :input-model '((:post-menu popup-test)))))

;; selecting the items in submenu calls the callback-func:

(display (make-instance 'test))

;; selecting the items in (right-click) submenu does not call the
;; callback-func:

(display (make-instance 'interface
			:menu-bar-items (list m2)
			:visible-min-height 100
			:visible-min-width 100))

                 <pre>

    &gt Both "display" examples work for me on Mac 64-bit Lispworks
    &gt 6.1.1, if by work you mean I get the popup when I select "blue"
    &gt from the second-level menu.

Thanks for checking.  Yes exactly, selecting items from the submenu
(ie. "blue") doesn't call the callback to set up any display-message on
this lisp.

Ive got LW Professional 6.1.1 on Linux here, so i guess this suggests
theres a bug in this distro/version, or perhaps something with gtk?.

Ive got a thread going with lisp-support on this, and will follow up
there, and post the conclusions here when they arrive.

If anybody else is on linux, and could confirm or refute, i'd now if its
me or lw.

When checking directly in the IDE now (trashed ~/.lispworks-config and
using a 'fresh' lw-image), none of the sub-menu-actions of any
context-menu (right-click) work at all - "Expression"-&gt"Documentation",
"Expression"-&gt"Evaluate Region" :-/

Ive almost not touched the ide (working inside slime) yet myself, but if
its a bug i cant beleive others on linux havent complained.  So im very
much hoping its something i screwed up, and somebody's got cure.

    P&gt The right-click actions work for me in LWW.

Thanks for checking.  Ive heard from others also it works on their
installations, something weird platform-dependencies, possibly gtk+-ish
or some such

Dont know whats happening yet, but lisp-support is doing work to try to
find out whats going on.  If other linux-users could test and send
reports it would help.

    P&gt Your code for the second window: (...)  doesn't contain an
    P&gt :input-model

I included it to compare the same menu used in 2 ways.

    &gt&gt Ive almost not touched the ide

    P&gt Why?  I find the debugger (etc) integration so useful, that I
    P&gt stopped using emacs with LW...

It does indeed seem very powerful.  Ive just started with lw for one
specific project, and find the various parts of slime do what i need,
besides being well integrated inside emacs.  I do actually setup lw's
process-browser for developing/debugging various mp: work, occasionally
also the class/method-browsers, and once-in-a-while been looking around
in more of the ide - it might get more use in time.

The main thing im missing is good debugging of ffi-code (mainly cffi),
do you think the lw-ide might help here?

                  xorg.conf</h1>
                 <pre>
The errors went away after unsetting "EmulateWheel" for mouse-3 (lenovos
trackpoint mouse) in one /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/*.conf file:

 	Option		"EmulateWheel"		"true"
     	Option		"EmulateWheelButton"	"3"

Commenting the above gets the 2nd- and higer-level context-menus working
as expected in lw.

The setting above is afaik a more or less standard mapping used on many
3-button mouse laptops.  My friend using gentoo has probably the same
settings, perhaps also as a standard setting in his dist.

Further, i cant see why this should break only lw, and only on the
callbacks for 2nd-level (or higher) context-menus.

Cheers.
