David -

This _IS_ great stuff, and as part of the work I'm doing on
common-lisp-stat (R-style system, but done through CL packages), I'd
like to use it.  However, I'm wary of using other peoples work without
knowing under what license (or lack-of license) they intend to use, so
that I can match the author's wishes.

What do you intend?  Public domain, MIT/BSD (which protects you a bit
more without restricting others), or...?

Thanks again!  Even if I can't use it directly (though probably I
can), it's great to have clean-room 3rd party code to use for
validation and conformance testing...

I second Pascal's thanks, and second his choice (which works in the
setting that you don't expect anything back, but want to ensure that
you don't get any blame or problems in return for errors or
misunderstandings).

And I was actually talking about the whole thing (numerics, visual
displays, and algorithms), and pre-existing common-lisp
implementations of robust statistical methods are very nice to have!
(I'm a research statistician by training and profession).

I've started a bit of generic packaging from forked copies, would be
interested in knowing if anyone else is doing such (ASDF/Quicklisp
oriented modifications).  Clearly the LW-specific code would need
modification for non-LW implementations, but lots of small components
seem to be working.
