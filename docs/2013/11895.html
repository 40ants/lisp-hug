<br>
I would like to thank everyone for the great feedback. The information you provided has been very helpful. It is exactly what I was looking for. It looks like I have found a winner!! I will be a LispWorks customer by the end of the week ;-).<br>
<br>
I have been doing some experimenting with CLOS, CLJSON and CLSQL. CLJSON can encode a standard CLOS class instance to json. CLSQL can do a similar thing from tables to a special kind of view class. The problem is that CLJSON chokes when trying to encode one
 of these view classes. I figured the solution would be to derive these view classes from a standard CLOS class and have CLJSON access the base class. In C&#43;&#43; you would simply cast an instance of a view class to it's base class. I'm having one heck of a time
 figuring out how to do this in Lisp. Is there a way to make the view class look like the base class when passing it as a parameter to CLJSON?<br>
<br>
Otherwise, I think I'm getting along fairly well (for a long time C/C&#43;&#43; programmer). Lisp seems to require a lot less scaffolding for things than C/C&#43;&#43; does. I took me little bit to figure out a way to think about the functional programming aspect of Lisp,
 but it's getting a little easier every day. I'm becoming quite fond of the LispWorks IDE. It has just what you need without a whole bunch of stuff that you don't. I was reading about the way that threads work and I'm looking forward to digging into that. It
 looks like a nice api. I will also be giving Edi's Hunchentoot a test drive very soon.<br>
<br>
It looks like my first Lisp major project is going to be recoding a C&#43;&#43; based business process engine in Lisp. I think it's an excellent candidate for Lispification. I might even be able to take advantage of the KnowledgeWorks stuff.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks again for your time and patience,<br>
Gerry&nbsp; <br>

I use Common Lisp a lot in my job, but I haven't been able to justify
the expense to my management to buy LispWorks for the following
reasons:

- I'm the only one in the company that uses Common Lisp, and while my
management supports my use, it is an exception to the norm.

- My development platform is Mac OS X, and again I'm in the relative
minority amongst the non web developers here. Most of my work is
multilingual (as in multiple human languages) and Mac OS X gives me
the best platform for that. However, if I want to share anything I'm
writing I need to build for Windows and Linux.

- I work with a lot of data: a 64-bit compiler is essential.

Given the above we would need to buy Enterprise licenses for three
platforms, which is just too expensive when I have compilers like CCL
and SBCL available and Emacs + Slime. Even though I'd love to use the
LispWorks GUI, and be able to write cross-platform GUI apps
(everything right now is command-line based) I can't.

This is not to bash LispWorks: my experience with LispWorks Personal
has been exemplary and I wish I could support it, but my personal
checkbook can't afford the Enterprise license for the Mac and my
employer can't justify it.

Hi Tom,

Have you looked at EQL? I have played with it a little bit and it seemed capable. I've used Qt for years and it is awesome.

Thanks,
Gerry
