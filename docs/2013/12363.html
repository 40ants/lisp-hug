                <h1>COMM can't register libssl (64-bit Windows)</h1>
                <pre>
Hi,

I'm running some https client requests on LW 64-bit (Windows), but even
though the libssl dll is present on my machine LispWorks constantly gives me
the following error:

Could not register handle for external module "libssl32.dll"

So it looks like it can't find the actual library (indeed calling
comm:ensure-ssl by itself also gives this error). I've tried running the
requests using both Drakma and Portable Aserve's client functions, and both
return this error. I installed OpenSSL using the Win64 package available
from http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html. Interestingly the
64-bit package actually installs the libssl32.dll - don't know if that is
significant or not.

Anyone have any idea what's going on?

Thanks,
Chris

Anyone have a clue on this? I can't seem to pick the libraries up with
ensure-ssl whatever I pass as the library-path. I have libssl32.ddl and
libeay32.dll in both System32 and SysWOW64, but neither works. It's
register-module that seems unable to see them, though I can use
register-module to load them if I pass the explicit paths. The problem is
that the http request code calls ensure-ssl internally.
