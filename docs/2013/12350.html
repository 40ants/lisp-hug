                <h1>Error after logic board replaced</h1>
                <pre>
I got my MacBook Pro back from the Apple genius bar, and the logic board was replaced. Now I'm getting the following error when trying to start up LispWorks:

LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed for the application /Users/paladin/dev/lisp/LispWorks 5.1/LispWorks.app with error -10810.

Anyone have any idea?

Hi John Doe,

This is most likely to be a permissions error.
Check that the LispWorks executable in the application bundle has the execution bit set.
How did you copy your files?


Regards,
Cam

Is there anything in syslog (based on http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/487766-fixed-lsopenurlswithrole-failed-with-error-10810/) there might be logs which tell you what it is failing to do more specifically.

I bet they put some more-or-less toxic OS update onto the machine (Apple seem to be losing track of the idea that "working" is a feature).
