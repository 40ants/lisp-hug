                <pre>
Hi,

Does anyone have experience in doing 3d transforms in LispWorks? I'm looking for a way of transforming an image in the same way as the CSS rotateY does (an example is here: http://desandro.github.io/3dtransforms/examples/transforms-01-functions.html)

It seems like the transforms available in CAPI/GP can only handle affine transformations, which means that parallel lines in the source will stay parallel in the target image. So an external library of some sort would probably be needed.

Erik

Hi Erik,

&gt Does anyone have experience in doing 3d transforms in LispWorks?

I wrote some code for doing 3D transformations a couple of years ago.
I'd be happy to make that open source, but I'd need to spend an hour
or two to isolate the code from the project it is a part of.

I think that affine 3D transformations are powerful enough to implement the
rotateY from your example.  But the problem with CAPI's transforms is that
they are 2D, not 3D.
