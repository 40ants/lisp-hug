                <h1>Lispworks POP interface</h1>
                <pre>     I'm writing a Lispworks email indexing application
which needs to download email from a POP server.
Has anybody already written a Lispworks interface to POP?
I've looked at the open source Allegro imap.cl file which
interfaces Allegro 6.2 to POP.

Has anybody already tried to convert imap.cl to a Lispworks version?
imap.cl calls:

(socket:make-socket :remote-host host :remote-port port)

and imap.cl calls:

(send-command-get-results
     socket
     command-string
     untagged-response-function
     check-for-success-function)

The above might have to be replace by Lispworks calls like:

(with-open-stream (x
(comm:open-tcp-stream
host port
:element-type '(unsigned-byte 8)))
(write-sequence command-string x)
(force-output x)
(let ((response (make-array 20 :element-type 'base-char)))
(values (read-sequence response x) res)))

If you used imap.cl you might want to consider using the acl-compat 
library that is part of Portable AllegroServe. With this approach you 
probably won't have to change any of the networking code.


Best,

John DeSoi, Ph.D.

I've used Franz' code to implement an application in LispWorks to test
an IMAP server. IIRC this was rather easy using ACL-COMPAT. You should
check that first. Let me know if you don't succeed and I'll dig out
the code I was talking about.

Cheers,
Edi.

Yes I have.  It has not been roughly tested and right now
it is copyright.
If you give it a try you can use it.  If others could
give it a quick try I would appreciate it.

If I do release it it will be under a BSD license.

You can get it from

yes, it's rather toyish (it's really a part of my personal
spam-fighting software), but maybe I should clean it a little up and
release it?

oh well, no time for that, I'll just paste the relevant part of

Yes I tried it and it seems that it works using ACL-COMPAT.

It might be interesting for you (and maybe others?)
that I plan to open source my email system called "Mel" which consists
of ~ 10000 LOC under a BSD style license soon.

It contains implementations of POP3, IMAP, Maildir, SMTP, MIME 
(including multipart stuff).

I'm over writing an article series for a German magazine about it.

ciao,
Jochen Schmidt

CL-HTTP has a POP3 interface in its distribution. It
also works with LispWorks.
