                <h1>Server Toolbar</h1>
                <pre>I'm trying to come up with a simple interface for  a delivered 
application on Mac OS X 10.3.6.

I'd like to have an application toolbar with a couple features: quit, 
start service, stop service.

Perhaps down the road I'll add a server monitoring window.

Does anybody know how to do  this with minimal CAPI overhead?

Any  example code?

I'd like  not to have an empty window or have the app shut down if  the 
window is closed.

I couldn't find discussion in the LW 4.3.7 manuals for how to do this.

Hi John,

Check out the delivery manual! The delivery keyword you're looking for 
is :quit-when-no-windows, which defaults to T.

                 <pre>John,

You can find a toolbar example along with a lot of other capi examples 
in the library folder of your LispWorks folder. You might want to start 
with

examples/capi/elements/toolbar.lisp


The examples/configuration folder has some code to help you build a 
nice OS X bundle application. The details with an example are covered 
in the delivery manual -- section 9.3. To control if the application 
quits when there are no windows you use the deliver keyword 
:quit-when-no-windows.

Best,

John DeSoi, Ph.D.
