                <h1>Using LispWorks with SLIME on Windows</h1>
                <pre>I was able to get SLIME to work with both CLISP and ACL under Win2000 (see
my blog entries for the last few days at
http://home.comcast.net/~bc19191/blog/index.html). I am now trying to get
SLIME (http://www.cliki.net/SLIME) working with the LispWorks free Personal
edition on MS Windows. There is support in SLIME for LispWorks on Linux;
however, the commands that are used to start up a socket communication on
LW under Linux don't exist on the MS Windows version of LW. The specific
functions that are missing are:

SYSTEM:SET-SIGNAL-HANDLER
SYSTEM::GETPID

According to the LW documentation, "set-signal-handler" is "applicable only
on UNIX/Linux/Mac OS". I also had a look at the symbols in the system
package in LW and "getpid" is not there either. There are ~65 different LW
functions/macros used in the Linux version of SLIME for LW. I suspect that
most of these will be consistent on both the Win32 and Linux versions of
LW. However, is there some Xanalys "master list" that identifies which
functions/macros are platform specific?

Has anyone been using LW with SLIME on Windows and worked out what the
equivalent functions are? Alternatively, any ideas for work-arounds (other
than using UNIX/Linux/MacOS ;-) of course)?

Thanks,
Bill Clementson
