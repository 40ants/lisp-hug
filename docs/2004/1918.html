                <h1>2 capi questions</h1>
                <pre>When selecting a cursor for a pane, the list of
available cursors is limited, and they don't all seem
correct.  I want to indicate that a particular item
will respond to being clicked.  Just like in a web
browser: when you move the cursor over such an item,
the cursor becomes a finger.  Is there any other way
to indicate a cursor than by keywords such as :hand
etc.?  Or is there any way to get a finger cursor with
LWW other than by going behind capi and using the
win32 api to change the cursor?  Or is any particular
capi cursor recommended to indicate that an item will
respond to being clicked?

When there is an infinite loop of errors in capi, a
command-line error screen opens.  After fixing the
problem and going back to normal Lispworks usage, that
error screen becomes a zombie and stays there.  How
can I get rid of it without terminating Lispworks?  If
I click the upper-right-corner-X to close the window,
it terminates Lispworks.

                 <pre>Hello Eric,

I do call Win32 APIs to load a .cur-file and get a handle, then invoke
undocumented CAPI methods to assign the cursor to a distinctive output pane
area. (Please take a look at my YGrid project for details and source code.)

I wish I could do the same thing in a more regular, portable, and
documented way :-)

&gt Why not minimize the window?

My Windows taskbar is too crowded.  I would typically
use the window one time and have it sit there idle for
the next week.

It doesn't really matter that much, but I'm just
curious to know whether there is a way to close it
without terminating Lispworks.  Since Lispworks has no
problem running without it until the first time it's
needed, it seems logical that I should be able to go
back to that state after fixing the bug.  And of
course it should be able to reopen the window the next
time it needs it.

I also have problems closing capi interface windows
with bugs.  Normally I would just use the Lispworks
process browser and tell it to kill the process.  But
sometimes that has no effect, if the process is stuck
in the wrong kind of error loop.  Is there any way to
force a Lispworks process to terminate immediately?
