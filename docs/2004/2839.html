                <h1>LWM and LWW</h1>
                <pre>Hello,

We started to port our software from LWM to LWW. For the most part 
this work has advanced very well.
We have, however,  encountered some problems in LWW:


(1) in LWW we get  an error if we call 'apply' with a list who's 
length is greater than 255,
Is there a way to specify the length of the argument list for 'apply' 
(LWM seems to be
more tolerant when calling 'apply').

(2) whan a capi window is selected with a click in the window area, 
it receives extra events (click.-down,  click-motion, and 
click-release or for input-models: (:button-1  :press) (:button-1 
:motion) (:button-1  :release)).  In LWM the window is only selected. 
Is there a way to avoid these
extra events in LWW ?

Mikael

&gt
&gtI'm not sure what you mean by extra events. Do you have some example
&gtcode illustrating the issue?

Here is a simple test:

(capi:define-interface test ()
   ()
   (:panes (opengl capi:opengl-pane
                   :input-model
                   '(((:button-1  :press)  testl-button1-press)
                     ((:button-1  :motion) test-button1-press-motion)
                     ((:button-1  :release) test-button1-release)))))

(defmethod testl-button1-press (&amp;rest args)
   (print 'press))
(defmethod test-button1-press-motion (&amp;rest args)
   (print 'motion))
(defmethod test-button1-release (&amp;rest args)
   (print 'release))

(capi:find-interface 'test)

If I select in LWM the window by clicking in the opengl-pane area, 
there are no prints, as the first
click is used only to select the window. After this any further 
clicks in the opengl-pane area
are printed as expected.

If the same operation is carried out in LWW (i.e. a selection click 
in the  in opengl-pane area), the window is selected AND I get all 3 
prints: 'press', 'motion' and 'release'.

We would prefer the LWM behaviour as here the selection click only 
selects the window and does not affect the
state of the window otherwise (like deselecting some objects, etc.).

(Just as a parenthesis: This behaviour seems also to be the case with 
the LWW text editor, as you do not loose a text selection, if you 
select the editor window with a click in the editing area.)

The limit in LW is very low, but why do you want to call apply on
that many arguments?

We have ported our code from MCL and for the most part the process has
been very smooth when dealing with Common Lisp and CLOS related code.

The limit is indeed much higher in MCL (at least 5000 elements, which is enough
for our purposes). We can of course rewrite our code but occasionally 
the 'apply'
function is very handy. For me the LW limit seems to be very low.

                  <pre>LW's backquote implementation (mis)uses apply, so you can't read certain 
backquoted expressions in LWW.  256 is a pretty low limit for backquote...

&gtCould you show us an example of that? I didn't know that the LispWorks
&gtbackquote implementation uses (or misuses) APPLY.

&gt
&gtFurther, Chris Reisbeck has pointed out (in mail that did not reach
&gtthe list) that the Common Lisp standard only guarantees 50 as the
&gtminimum for CALL-ARGUMENTS-LIMIT, so counting on anything more means
&gtyou're writing non-portable code.
&gt
&gtNonetheless we will investigate raising the value of
&gtCALL-ARGUMENTS-LIMIT for a future LispWorks release.
&gt
OK, thanks for this information. We should have no problems porting our code
using 'reduce', etc.
