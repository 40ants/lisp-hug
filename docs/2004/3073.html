Lots of different things, including educational software, biological
modelling software, database-backed web sites,  interactive data
analysis software and more.

I see you're from Russia, by the way.  My very first Lispworks project
was a simple program to print Russian conversational cards (Russian
conversation on one side, Dutch on the other side) for people who
want to study Russian.

All kinds of software that runs my company, an internet stock trading
company. Since the ILC-2003 proceedings still seem to be just wishware,
I've put my paper and slides (which were really about "what we do with
lisp") here if you're interested:

'Padezh' :)  ('Padozh' and 'padenie' are unrelated words).

&gt You're not the only Lisper in Russia, though.

Me too :)  Actually I am co-worker of lisptracker.

There is scientific center in Novosibirsk, and McCarthy visited it
once (in 1970-s, I think).  And he helped to Ludmila Gorodnyaya to
implement Lisp for BESM-6 computer.  Now she teaches Lisp in High
College of Computer Science.  And I know some other Lisp enthusiasts
from Novosbibrsk.

So, these who say that it is hard to find Lisp programmers are wrong:
lispers can be found even in Siberia :)))  And Lisp jobs can be found
as well :)

I build tools for developing embedded systems - e.g. compilers for 
application-specific languages.

I am building and using a visual language toolset - editors, compilers, 
debuggers for a language whose source code consists of 2D diagrams and has 
"reactive" semantics (e.g. CALL / RETURN does not appear as a top-level 
construct).  The visual language has been used in our consulting / contract 
work to program 8051-based embedded systems and general programming.  All 
previous versions of the language and tools were OEM'ed (custom built for 
specific projects).  The new toolset (written in LW) is meant to be a 
commercializable version of the language and tools, while capitalizing and 
extending on our experience with these concepts over the past decade.

Sidebar:  When you build a visual language, you need to provide an editor for 
that language.  It turns out that all 2D drawing tools that we looked at 
(e.g. Visio, Paint, HotDraw, etc, etc) were all horrible and klunky when 
applied to the task of writing code (for a visual language).  So, we also had 
to invent a "code editor" for the visual language - kind of like an emacs for 
graphics.  That's done in LW, too.

Sidebar: If you know something about compilers, you know that they are 
traditionally built in four phases - scan, parse, semantics and 
code-emission.  We built the compiler for the graphical language that way, 
also.  The "scanner" and the "parser" are built using a prolog (backtracking, 
rule-based) mentality - for example the parser "infers" that four lines can 
be parsed as a "box".  Also done in LW, using macros+functions to jump into 
the prolog paradigm as required.
