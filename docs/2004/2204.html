                <h1>compile-system bug?</h1>
                <pre>I have a file that I use to load some tests, etc. Here are some lines from 
the top of the file:

        (load "engine-defsys.lisp")

        (compile-system 'engine)
        (load-system 'engine)

I've often noticed that when I load this file I'm warned that fasl files 
are out of date. But, um, if they are, why doesn't compile-system compile 
them...?

So: when I compile-system from the listener out-of-date files are *always* 
compiled, but when I use the same command in a file which is loaded 
they're usually *but not always* compiled. Is there some reason behaviour 
would be different in the two environments? Is this a LispWorks bug, a doc 
bug, or a user bug?

It happens from time to time--as a wild guess, perhaps once every four or 
five times I load the test file.

&gt You could investigate further by tracing FILE-WRITE-DATE to see if
&gt that's returning unexpected results inside COMPILE-SYSTEM.

Ok. 

Btw, it's almost as though load-sytem sees the difference but 
compile-system doesn't; load-system always reliably reports that one or 
more files is out of date. That's how I know there's a problem, and then I 
just run compile-system from the listener which seems to always work.

&gt Hard to say without a full report. As well as the bug-form, your
&gt system definition and the output from both the from-file and
&gt from-listener cases, it would be useful to know whether the files are
&gt all local.

Ok.

I've never encountered. What about
    (compile-system 'engine :load t) ?
