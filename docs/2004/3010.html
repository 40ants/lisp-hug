                <h1>CAPI newbe</h1>
                <pre>Using LW I can't help but notice that my mouse scroll button dosn't work.
Also drag and drop of lisp files into CAPI dosn't work.
Are these features part of the current CAPI release?
If so how do I access them in my own code?

Here's an old article that might help for LWW:

| &gt Under Windws 2000, LWW 4.2, the wheel on my microsoft mouse does
not
| &gt work.  I can live without it, but if anybody knows how to enable
it,
| &gt I'd be interested.
| 
| This is not ideal, but here's something the Xanalys support team
told
| me about a year or so ago:
| 
| There's a thing called MouseWheel available at
|
http://www.microsoft.com/msj/defaultframe.asp?page=/msj/0697/hood0697.
htm&amp;nav=/msj/0697/newnav.htm
| 
| The file you want is called Hood0697.exe.
| 
| It works by intercepting the wheel messages and turning them into
| scroll messages.
| 
| You have to tell it about every application for which you want it to
| intercept the wheel messages, so if you are producing delivered
| applications from LW, you need to tell MouseWheel about those as
well
| as telling it about LW itself. If you are passing on delivered apps
| to other people, those people will need MouseWheel too.
| 
| To make MouseWheel start automatically at startup, add a shortcut to
| mw.exe in your ...\Start Menu\Programs\Startup folder.
| 
| It would be much nicer if LW itself handled the wheel messages --
| perhaps Xanalys could add that to the Wish List for the next release
| or the one after?

The link no longer works -- it's been moved to
http://www.microsoft.com/msj/0697/hood0697.aspx

Simon.
