                <pre>Hi,

You don't implement READER-METHOD-CLASS and WRITER-METHOD-CLASS.


All the best,
Pascal

                 <h1>Evaluating forms in a delivered LW app</h1>
                 <pre>I am making a binary app of a cl-http application in LW under Mac OS 10.3.3.

I'd like to figure out a good way to evaluate forms in a listener both
locally and over the net.

Anybody have experience and recommendations?

I'm thinking a telnet server running in lisp that only talks to the local
host would work.

Anybody tried this?

What about ssh?

Alternatives?

(and yes, I suppose I could use Web listener example from cl-http, perhaps with
some additional enhancements.)

                 <pre>Thanks Sven!

This looks like a good approach.

It would be nice if the code had some error handling and allowed access
to the LW text debugger.

A command to debug a process would  be nice too.

For that matter, a command processor and lisp  evaluator like
the LispM 3600-login protocol would  be ideal.

                 <pre>Thanks for your code, Sven.

I have tuned it up some for my purposes and you will find it attached.

It would be nice to email backtraces easily too.

Perhaps there are some additional commands that would be convenient
for remote debugging.
