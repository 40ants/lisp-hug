                <h1>Files in the .app bundle</h1>
                <pre>Hi!

Is there a way to access files within an .app bundle (folder) from a
delivered LW application? I'm thinking about putting the (HTML) help
files of my application into the bundle so the user has only one
"file" to move around.

Is that a good idea? Is that how it's usually done on OS X? Is there a
specific place within the .app bundle where doc files should reside?

Thanks,
Edi.

Sure, this is what the bundle is for. Keeps everything together but 
appears to the user as a single file. The docs are generally put in the 
Resources folder. If you are going to localize for multiple languages, 
each one would have a folder inside Resources. Take a look inside a few 
application packages in your Application folder to get a feel for how 
things are generally organized (control click on the application and 
choose "Show Package Contents" from the context menu).

Best,
