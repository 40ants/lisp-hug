                <h1>:top-level-hook</h1>
                <pre>It appears that :top-level-hook is ignored in LispWorks for Macintosh.

I have an application which requires establishing handlers for 
conditions we use to indicate that the underlying data substrate has 
changed.  Also, we'll want to wrap a handler to trap all errors and 
react gracefully in the delivered application.

Does anyone have suggestions on what to do in this case?

&gt
&gtYou could try setting *DEBUGGER-HOOK* or bind it via
&gtMP:*PROCESS-INITIAL-BINDINGS*.

Using *DEBUGGER-HOOK* won't work for the conditions we use as they're 
signalled via SIGNAL, not ERROR (or CERROR).

Will using MP:*PROCESS-INITIAL-BINDINGS* affect the Cocoa event 
processor process if I modify it before saving an image (either by 
SAVE-IMAGE or DELIVER)?

Is there any chance of making :TOP-LEVEL-HOOK work on the Mac?

&gt
&gtPerhaps you will need to consider changing that. Otherwise I suppose
&gtyou could force entry into the debugger by setting *BREAK-ON-SIGNALS*,
&gtbut that's rather gross.

&gt
&gtNo, because
&gt
&gta) MP:*PROCESS-INITIAL-BINDINGS* is used only at process creation
&gttime, and
&gt
&gtb) In any case, you can't do SAVE-IMAGE or DELIVER after the Cocoa
&gtEvent Loop process has started.
&gt
&gt    Is there any chance of making :TOP-LEVEL-HOOK work on the Mac?
&gt
&gtNot in this release. We'd need per-interface multiprocessing for
&gtthat. This feature is on the wish list for a future release but is not
&gtcurrently scheduled.

Thanks for the information.

Consider this a request to schedule per-interface multiprocessing 
sooner (i.e., next release) rather than later.
