                <h1>SLIME vs Deliver anyone?</h1>
                <pre>
I am having my first real encounter with deliver, and so far it's been going rather well.  However, 
I've had the idea that SLIME might serve as the interface to the delivered image - there will only 
be a few users who are already used to Emacs, so I'm thinking that the command-history etc. would be 
welcome.

BUT: I get an error when I try to connect to the port on which the slime backend process is listening:

	ERROR: REQUIRE called in delivery time with module twoway-stream.

I am not sure how to pursue this problem and wonder if anyone on the list might have ideas?

Thanks in advance.

-Klaus.

A wild and uneducated guess:  the error message seems to indicate that all 
REQUIRE's need to be performed before deliver is called.  This makes me think 
that you have a REQUIRE inside the code that you are delivering.

Try removing the REQUIRE's from the code and move those REQUIRE's to the 
deliver.lisp code, for example:

(load-all-patches)
(require "blah")
(load "myprog")
(deliver ...

?
