                <h1>Novice Sockets and MCL</h1>
                <pre>I need to get a simple socket connection between two processes that run
independently of one another.  I have found some info on the web but so far
I have been unable to establish a server socket that allows a client to
connect using 
    (setf socket (ccl:open-tcp-stream host port) )
The real problem is that I can't get an established identity of the socket.
Instead of (ccl::open-tcp-stream host port) returning a stream identity it
just sucks up all of the processes resources.  This has been true for all
the examples I have found on the web as well.  Can anyone help? I would
really appreciate it.
Cheers, Andrew

The example at the end of the following manual page walks you through  
the setup of both a server and client, talking to each other over  
TCP/IP, in the same lisp image - if that is what you are looking for,  
if not it should give you a head start.
