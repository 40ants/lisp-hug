                <h1>HTTP problem</h1>
                <pre>I'm trying to use the example from 
http://www.lispworks.com/reference/lw43/LWRM/html/lwref-27.htm to 
download the www.lispworks.com main page. Instead of downloading the 
page I've got the following:

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Date: Sat, 03 Apr 2004 19:03:10 GMT
Server: Apache/2.0.39 (Win32)
Location: http://www.xanalys.com/
Content-Length: 305
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1

&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN"&gt
&lt;html&gt&lt;head&gt
&lt;title&gt301 Moved Permanently&lt;/title&gt
&lt;/head&gt&lt;body&gt
&lt;h1&gtMoved Permanently&lt;/h1&gt
&lt;p&gtThe document has moved &lt;a 
href="http://www.xanalys.com/"&gthere&lt;/a&gt.&lt;/p&gt
&lt;hr /&gt
&lt;address&gtApache/2.0.39 Server at www.zanalys.com Port 80&lt;/address&gt
&lt;/body&gt&lt;/html&gt


Is it a bug in the documentation? What should I do to download the 
proper page? I'm not very familiar with the http.

Thanks,

Michal

You have done nothing wrong. This is a standard HTTP response that 
means the page you requested has been moved. If you were using a 
browser it would automatically redirect you to the address in the 
Location: header. So just request www.xanalys.com in your request to 
get the main page.

Best,

John DeSoi, Ph.D.

&gt Thank you for your response, but I want to download the

&gt
&gt The code from the example:
&gt
&gt (with-open-stream (http (comm:open-tcp-stream
&gt                           "www.lispworks.com" 80))
&gt    (format http "GET / HTTP/1.0~C~C~C~C"
&gt                 (code-char 13) (code-char 10)
&gt                 (code-char 13) (code-char 10))
&gt    (force-output http)
&gt    (write-string "Waiting to reply...")
&gt    (loop for ch = (read-char-no-hang http nil :eof)
&gt          until ch
&gt          do (write-char #\.)
&gt             (sleep 0.25)
&gt          finally (unless (eq ch :eof)
&gt                    (unread-char ch http)))
&gt    (terpri)
&gt    (loop for line = (read-line http nil nil)
&gt          while line
&gt          do (write-line line)))

Looks like Xanalys has changed their server settings and hasn't
updated their example. I guess www.lispworks.com is now a 'named
virtual host' on the same server that also runs www.xanalys.com. So
this is likely to work:

(with-open-stream (http (comm:open-tcp-stream
                          "www.lispworks.com" 80))
   (format http "GET / HTTP/1.0~C~CHost: www.lispworks.com~C~C~C~C"
                (code-char 13) (code-char 10)
                (code-char 13) (code-char 10)
                (code-char 13) (code-char 10))
   (force-output http)
   (write-string "Waiting to reply...")
   (loop for ch = (read-char-no-hang http nil :eof)
         until ch
         do (write-char #\.)
            (sleep 0.25)
         finally (unless (eq ch :eof)
                   (unread-char ch http)))
   (terpri)
   (loop for line = (read-line http nil nil)
         while line
         do (write-line line)))

The example code didn't send a 'Host' header and thus you were
redirected to Apache's 'default host' - my guess...

AFAIK this is not exactly correct. The example explicitely states
HTTP/1.0 for the protocol and the conversation is done in
HTTP/1.0. It's just that Apache's 'name-based virtual hosts' (several
hosts with different names using the same IP address) don't work
unless the client sends a 'Host' header. This is a reasonable approach
taken by the Apache guys because virtually every browser has sent
'Host' headers for years although very few implemented the full
HTTP/1.1 protocol.
