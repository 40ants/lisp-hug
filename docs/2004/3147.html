                <h1>scrolling an editor-pane (LWM)</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

OK, try running the capi/editor/editor-pane.lisp example in OS/X.

Type a bunch of new lines into the end of the buffer, now play around 
with the scroll bar -- scroll up and down, click on the arrow buttons, 
click in the scroll bar proper. Try the beginning of buffer and end of 
buffer buttons (watch the scroll bar). This is not how scroll bars are 
supposed to work on OS/X.

If you paste some text into the buffer you get different, more subtle 
misbehaviour -- the thumb of the scrollbar varies in size as you scroll 
through but only by a bit (use the arrow buttons to see).

So I checked the editor in the IDE. Same problem.

Is this just OS/X or is this everywhere?

Cheers,
Bob

I'm using LWW, and I also think scroll bars in editor panes
are a bit strange.

I think at least part of what's happpening is that the thumb of
the scroll bar shows what proportion of the buffer's characters
are bing displayed, rather than the more normal proportion of
the buffer's lines.

Yes, I submitted a bug report recently and this was the explanation. 
This behavior is apparently the Emacs way of doing things.

Hopefully in some future release there will be an option to get the 
correct platform native behavior. The functionality is wonderful, but 
the visual and behavioral quirks will be difficult to explain. A few 
other issues include:

- no standard blinking insertion cursor (feature request submitted for 
this)
- with "Delete Selection Mode" on, highlighted text is deleted when the 
delete key is pressed but it should also be replaced if any other 
character is typed
