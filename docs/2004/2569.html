Cool! Thanks for this great contribution!

Unfortunately, I seem to have problems using jfli on Linux (Debian
testing with Sun JDK 1.4.2_04). Here's what happens:

You may need to set the java.library.path - see the way it's done in
examples/swtdemo.lisp. Set it to be the path that contains libjvm.so.

Hope that helps,

Thanks to you and Barry Wilkes for your help. It seems like setting
java.library.path has no effect while using LD_LIBRARY_PATH makes a
difference. However, the result is still not what I'd like to have:

  edi@bird:/tmp/jfli$ echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
  /usr/local/lib/j2sdk1.4.2_04/jre/lib/i386:/usr/local/lib/j2sdk1.4.2_04/jre/lib/i386/client:/usr/local/lib/j2sdk1.4.2_04/jre/lib/i386/server

I should have mentioned that these errors are expected, and are worked
around (via a combination of inefficiency and truncation) in the jfli layer.

I hope Xanalys is able to see what a great contribution to LispWorks
jfli is and will support it as needed in their next release.

Works like a charm for me (Mac OS X 10.3.4, LWM 4.3.7).

Is there a way to undo #'CREATE-JVM (to close or restart it), or is

In a long-running server process, this might be useful (e.g. when API

Rich,

I have a question regarding GC: what happens to objects that you create 
in the jvm using jfli in terms of their lifecycle ?
Can they become garbage while lisp is still holding references to them, 
or are they only gc-ed when the last lisp reference is gone ?

As for features, would it be possible to keep some of the meta info 
that you build up during def-java-class around for later use ?
I would for example like to have a simple way to convert a jfli pointer 
to a java object into a clos object of my own.
If I could ask the jfli object or class for all its java beans 
properties, that would be great.
Additionally, generic slot-value access using bean property names would 
be nice.

Sven

PS: Maybe these discussions have to move to another mailing list ? Is 
the one on sf.net already active ?
