                <h1>CAPI newbe</h1>
                <pre>Using LW I can't help but notice that my mouse scroll button dosn't work.
Also drag and drop of lisp files into CAPI dosn't work.
Are these features part of the current CAPI release?
If so how do I access them in my own code?

It seems to me these problems have been apparent for three years at least.
Why have they been ignored?

                  <h1>Features in a LispWorks Release</h1>
                  <pre>&gt We appreciate feedback posted on this list and we refer to it when 
&gt designing new versions of LispWorks. Of course, there is not enough 
&gt time to include everything that's requested.

Have you guys ever invited public discussion on what should be in the next 
release? I think that might be helpful--for users, at least. :-)

(Actually, finding out what will be in a release isn't easy, and not 
knowing has been rather frustrating.)
