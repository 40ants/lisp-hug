                <h1>creating a wordprocessor like widget using CAPI</h1>
                <pre>Hello

Over the last few days I have experimented with creating a widget in 
CAPI that can display structured markup such as xml, html and custom 
formats.

It is fairly easy to use pinboard-layout to create a read-only display 
of either the html/xml code with custom indentation, different colors 
and fonts for tags and text etc., custom line wrap policies and the 
like, and it is equally easy to create a web-browser/word-proessor style 
view of the same data with headers in big bold letters on lines by 
themself, extra vertical space in between paragraphs, bullet lists etc.

However making these widgets editable, so the user can type characters, 
delete characters, cut'n paste text, select text, select say a header in 
the word-processor view or a tag in the html/xml view, seems to be left 
as a non-trivial and time consuming exercise for the programmer. The 
editor-pane is not useable for this purpose, because it only supports 
text and only one font for the whole editor.

Now before I run away to javax.swing.JTextPane and its friends, I would 
like to ask if  I am the only one who has been looking for something 
like this functionality in CAPI, and if perhaps someone somewhere has a 
solution. Also if possible it would be good to hear if xanalys is 
working on adding something like this to CAPI in a not so distant future.
