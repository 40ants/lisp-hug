                <h1>numeric performance of LW</h1>
                <pre>There's a recent thread in c.l.l. which was started by a nameless troll,
but which was followed up by some lispers which took the challenge and
translated the numeric benchmark into code that was close to C in speed
with both cmucl and sbcl, and Duane Rettig followed up with a beta
for the upcoming ACL 6.2 which made it almost as fast. I tried this
version: http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~bmastenb/misc/almabench.lisp
of the benchmark with LispWorks 4.3.6 (linux), and it wasn't exactly
impressing - it's very evident that the declarations won't stop LW
from consing like hell (se end of message. Actually I think it's
pretty impressive that it is that fast, given that it has allocated
40 GIGABYTES!).

I've tried to do some numeric optimizations in LW before, with little
luck, so I wonder if there is something I miss here, or if LW 
actually is quite bad at this kind of numeric stuff?

Note: I'm doing this mostly out of curiousity, for my actual work LW
has so far been more than fast enough. But who knows, I might be doing
something involving floats next, and I'd like not having to switch to
CMUCL or SBCL for that!

I'd LOVE to have unboxed 32-bit integers, though, I do a lot of crypto
stuff in my app, and that is really slow with bignums.  (Also on my
make-crypto-faster-wishlist is a built-in implementation of
exponential modulus, that would be really cool, it is the only thing
slowing down my homebrewed RSA code)

Here the timings:

LW 4.3.6 on Athlon XP 2200+-based workstation with linux 2.4/debian
unstable:
==============================================

CL-USER 19 &gt (time (almabench:main))
Timing the evaluation of (ALMABENCH:MAIN)

user time    =    455.280
system time  =      1.420
Elapsed time =   0:10:21
Allocation   = 40555763480 bytes standard / 66231 bytes conses
2 Page faults
Calls to %EVAL    33

SBCL on the same workstation:
=============================

* (time (almabench:main))

Evaluation took:
                 32.962 seconds of real time
                 4.11 seconds of user run time
                 0.08 seconds of system run time
                 0 page faults and
                 0 bytes consed.

On a totally different machine, PowerBook G4 1.25 Ghz, 1 Gb RAM, Mac OS 
10.3.2, LWM 4.3.6:

CL-USER 129 &gt  (time (almabench:main))
Timing the evaluation of (ALMABENCH:MAIN)

user time    =    450.460
system time  =      1.940
Elapsed time =   0:07:44
Allocation   = 40743601840 bytes
0 Page faults
Calls to %EVAL    31

As much as I would like a PowerPC G4 to beat an Athlon, this is not 
possible for this floating point code,
unless that code is heavily vectorized (which I don't think is the case 
here). Furthermore, altough my machine's load was 100%, it was still 
very responsive, which suggests that it wasn't completely occupied. I 
suspect LW was doing memory management most of the time, and not 
floating point calculations.

Sure. That's the problem. It isn't able to compile the code that
works with those floats and float-vectors into non-allocating code
(LW allocates 40GB while SBCL allocates nothing).

I'm also interested in learning more about this.

Adding #+LISPWORKS(FLOAT 0) to the (DECLAIM (OPTIMIZE ...)) form
seems to speed up the code by about 5% and also to reduce the consing
by 5%, but that's the only thing I can think of to get this code
faster.

A quick browse of the disassembly of PLANETPV shows a few places where
all the computations seem to be done on unboxed floats, but also quite
a few calls to SYSTEM::RAW-FAST-BOX-DOUBLE. It's not clear to me how the
the compiler decides when floats must be boxed.

Arthur Lemmens

Great work!
Do you think this will make it into the next patch package?
