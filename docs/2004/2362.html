                <h1>Listing KW structs?</h1>
                <pre>Is there a way within LispWorks (preferably one of the visual tools) to see
what structures (defined by def-kb-struct) kw knows about? Our app uses a
mix of classes and structs; the structs buy us a measurable performance
increase. It would helpful during development to be able to see these things
as we can kb classes. Thanks much, and apologies if I've missed something
obvious.

Can you explain what you mean? Where would you like to see them?
