    MK&gt Hi, Has anybody tried to run LispWorks in a Windows emulator,
    MK&gt e.g., Virtual PC?  

If you mean Virtual PC for the Mac (I vague remember there being something 
like that) then I have no experience.  

I boot Windows (NT, W2k, XP) under vmware under linux and compile windows
versions of my programs with LW pro/Win.  Never had a problem.  

    MK&gt I know that Xanalys declares that they
    MK&gt cannot guarantee it. It would be nice to hear if somebody has
    MK&gt got some experience on this.

About 1.5 years with lispworks, perhaps 2 with mingw, and ever since
vmware came out with everything else (Visual-&lt;mumble&gt, etc.).  It has
been solid for me.  Even when I did odd (unsuppotred) stuff like run
it on a diskless machine and keep its virtual disks on NFS, it was not
flaky.  But I do most of my development under Linux and mainly just
compile and sometimes debug FFI issues on windows.  (the guy who
tests, does it on native windows but I never had an unreproducable 
bug report due to this).

hope this helps,

BM

I've done it with LW Pro 4.3 running on Windows 98 running in QEMU hosted
on FreeBSD 4.10.

Yes I have: Virtual PC 6.0.1, Windows 95 (!), LispWorks Personal 
Edition 4.3.7, Mac OS 10.3.5, PowerBook G4.

PS: I had to install CygWin to make ASDF-Install work.

I have had running LW since 4.2.x in vmware on Linux guest system and 
Windows emulator.

I did some experiments with wine 18 months ago, it worked reasonably
well.

                  <pre>    I ran Lispworks about 6 months ago in Virtual PC.
It ran slowly but otherwise well.   On my 1 Ghz 1 Gigabyte
Powerbook G4,  it ran sort of like a 200 Mhz Pentium with
300 Meg of memory.
