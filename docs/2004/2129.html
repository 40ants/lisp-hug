                <h1>drag and drop graphics-pane nodes and tree-view nodes</h1>
                <pre>     I'm trying to build a drag-and-drop application
using capi:graph-pane and capi:tree-view.  So far
I can't find any sample code showing how to drag-and-drop
nodes of these panes,  so I've resorted to a workaround
of selecting nodes to copy source nodes and double-clicking target nodes
to paste what's copied.  Of course this is much less easy to explain 
and less
natural than drag-and-drop,  plus it uses up the double-click
gesture that I'd like to use for better things like making
a node 'execute' or editing a node's name.

     Does anybody have some example code to enable a really simple
drag-and-drop for capi:graph-pane and capi:tree-view?
It's good enough to just draw a rectangle outline of inverted-pixels
sized to the objected dragged while dragging,  and generating
a call-back to a function with args of dragged-node,  dragged-onto-node.
(Inverting pixels to outline a dragged object may save the effort of 
actually drawing
the dragged object on the screen)

This is the approach Macintosh Common Lisp (MCL) took with
their simple GUI interface builder;  it was only a few pages of code in 
MCL
and produced a highly robust,  intuitive interface builder.

                 <pre>Gosh maybe nobody is doing drag-and-drop in graph-panes.
Is anybody doing any kind of drag-and-drop in CAPI?
I'm just a beginner with CAPI so I'm hoping for any sort of advice.

Take a look at the documentation for the INPUT-MODEL slot of CAPI:OUTPUT-PANE.
That describes how to handle the mouse gestures.  Given the coordinates
of the mouse you'll need to figure out what objects your picking up and 
dropping.

                  <pre>Hi laurence,

There is an example that manipulates pinboard objects at:

..../examples/capi/graphics/pinboard-movement.lisp

It gives you a starting point.

Sebastien.
