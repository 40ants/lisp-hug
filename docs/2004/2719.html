                <h1>Source-code-location of editor source</h1>
                <pre>I've followed Xanalys's instructions to enable source code location
of the editor source, by copying these forms from a comment in
the Xanalys-supplied configure.lisp file to the script that builds
my tailored image:


;; load the logical host for the editor source code
(load-logical-pathname-translations "EDITOR-SRC") 

;; Configure source finding to know about editor source code
(setf dspec:*active-finders* 
  (append dspec:*active-finders* (list
#P"EDITOR-SRC:editor-tags-db")))


(FWIW, I had to swap the order of the above forms to be as shown above
-- I couldn't get things to work otherwise.)

When I evaluate (load-logical-pathname-translations "EDITOR-SRC")
I get a break that says:
  Failed to find logical translation for host EDITOR-SRC : C:\Program
Files\Xanalys\LispWorks\lib\4-3-0-0\translations\EDITOR-SRC does not
exist

It seems that in addition to what Xanalys's instructions say,
I also need to create a file editor-src.lisp in the translations
directory. I've done this, and placed the following form in
the file:

(setf (logical-pathname-translations "EDITOR-SRC")
      '(("*;*.*.*"
         "C:/Program
Files/Xanalys/LispWorks/lib/4-3-0-0/src/editor/")))

Everything seems to work fine, but I'm surprised that no-one else has
mentioned this as a problem. Have I missed something in Xanalys's
instructions? Have other people had to do the same as me? Is there
something wrong with my LispWorks installation?

Also, is the above (setf (logical-pathname-translations ...) ...)
form correct? It's a bit of a guess -- I don't understand logical
pathnames -- but it seems to work.

My init (.lispworks) file has these two forms, in this order, but 
without the #P on the last line

My installation (OS X) came with a file named "EDITOR-SRC.lisp" in the 
translations directory. This all works for me.

The file contains:

(in-package "CL-USER")

(setf (logical-pathname-translations "EDITOR-SRC")
       `(("*" ,(merge-pathnames
                (make-pathname :name :wild :directory '(:relative "src" 
"editor"))
                (sys:lisp-library-directory)))))
