                <h1>CAPI border thingy</h1>
                <pre>Is the nice looking pane that I see in Global Preferences dialog, and also
in the editor preferences (fonts, colors etc..) I'm referring to the bordered
groups of items (which mostly seem to be choice or button). It's shaded 
in Cocoa and the test in the title/label is smaller. On Motif it's just a single
line as a border. I've heard these called group boxes, borders, frames, to
name a few, and I'm wondering if they're available in CAPI, as they're 
obviously used in lispworks. I just don't know what widget they are, and the
user manual doesn't seem to touch on it (and I don't know where to look
in the reference manual..)

Look at the documentation for TITLED-OBJECT.

I think you want the TITLE-POSITION to be :FRAME.
