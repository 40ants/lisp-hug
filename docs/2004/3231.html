                <h1>setting the default character element type</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

I'm working on a project where I pretty much only deal with extended 
character sets. From the docs I think what I'm supposed to do is to 
call (set-default-character-element-type 'lw:simple-char) and from that 
point on the default character set will be simple-char.

In the LWM 4.3.x version of this program I had:

    (setf lw:*default-character-element-type* 'lw:simple-char)

as a top level form in a lisp file.  In other words, it would be run 
during delivery. Everything worked.

In LWM 4.4.0 if I do that I get a bus error immediately upon executing 
the delivered application. If I make sure that the 
(set-default-character-element-type 'lw:simple-char) expression is 
executed at run time rather than compile time I don't get the bus error 
(and I assume it is working).

Now, I'm not 100% sure this didn't happen in some versions of 4.3.x 
(e.g. the evaluation/personal version). I 'ported' the Closure XML 
package to LWM. I had no problem in LWM4.3 but the guys developing CXML 
never got past bus and segmentation errors.

Cheers,
Bob

I reported something like this in the 4.4 beta, but I never narrowed it 
down to anything consistent and reproducible. If you have a small 
sample that gives a bus error consistently, pleases send it to Xanalys 
support. Like you, I worked around the problem (I think) by moving 
things from compile time to run time. I believe the last time I saw 
this was in trying to set *editor-cursor-active-style* at compile time 
in delivery.

This has been really hard to debug. I would never get the error at low 
delivery levels or when symbols are kept in the image. I could often 
drag the application to the trash, compile again without changing 
anything, and then no error would occur. Same thing if I delivered at 
level 0 and then compiled again at level 4 with no changes.

Best,

John DeSoi, Ph.D.
