&gtHi. I want to confirm that our understanding of the CONTEXT goal is
correct.
&gt
&gtIn a sample app, we see the following behavior:
&gt
&gt1. A rule RHS has a (context) goal that pushes a new context onto the
stack.
&gt
&gt2. This rule completes firing.
&gt
&gt3. All remaining activations in the present context fire.
&gt
&gt4. Activations in the context pushed in step (1) fire.
&gt
&gtIf our observations are correct, I admit being surprised by step (3). Based
&gton my experiences with other shells, I expected to have the rule in (1)
&gtcomplete firing, then the new context made current and its activations
fire,
&gtthen "control" return to the "calling context". But, if that's how KW
&gtbehaves, fine. I just want to make sure I understand this correctly.

Hi,

KW could be seen as following its doc and popping contexts from the top 
of the stack once it has finished its current context. Just because you 
have pushed a new context doesn't mean that the current context has 
necessarily finished. If you want to implement the behaviour you want 
you can (return) from the current context immediately after pushing the 
new context.

That said, KW was somewhat patterned off other shells. It should 
probably do what the de facto standard is or at least have a context 
option where for doing that.

Ahem. We don't use the F-word here! :-j
