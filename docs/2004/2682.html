                <h1>Zooming a pinboard layout</h1>
                <pre>Hi

I need help on CAPI and GP.

I am writing a plotting application (which I plan to distribute) and I 
have all the basics in, but I'd like to add zooming (think Matlab) of 
the plot.

I think I figured out how to do clipping by using a 
simple-pinboard-layout enclosing my graph, but zooming is escaping me.  
Should I just go ahead and draw everything of a pixmap and then copy 
out only the necessary area, or there is something magic about the 
transforms handling that is escaping me?

Thanks fro your help,  just answer in private if you do not feel to 
bother the whole list with this.

Cheers

marco

Hi

I am still having problems with zooming the drawing in my 
pinboard-layout.  I got a response from Eduardo Munoz which helps, but 
does zooming centered at the origin which is not good enough.

I want the following:

1 - click at (x y)
2 - zoom the drawing using the layout as a viewport

with the following constraint

if (x1 y1) were the (x y) coordinates in the pre-zoomed drawing, (x2 
y2) = (x y) must be the coordinates in the post-zoomed drawing.

Essentially I do the drawing by

	(gp:with-graphics-translation (port viewport-x viewport-y)
	   (gp:with-graphics-scale (port zoomed-width zoomed-height)
                    ;; draw))

But, I have not figured out how to reliably compute VIEWPORT-X and 
VIEWPORT-Y.

I know this is basic CG stuff, but I am no good at this stuff.

I'd appreciate any help.

Thanks

Marco
