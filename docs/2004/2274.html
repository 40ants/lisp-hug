                <h1>listener / editor bug?</h1>
                <pre>I'd like to check whether this is already a known bug, before I spend a day 
trying to make a self-contained bug report and reproducible example - please 
let me know if this is already known and "in the works":

(under LWW 4.3.6)

During a session of debugging, where tons of debugging output was sent to the 
listener (literally minutes of continuous output), the editor started to 
quietly misbehave - I would make a change, recompile and rerun the test.  The 
result was exactly the same, for some hours, before I discovered that the 
edits were not "sticking".  The editor displayed the "changed" code, but did 
not save it to disk, even though I hit ^X^S and the changed indicator showed 
that the file had been saved.  

I also found that switching between files in the editor was strange - after 
hitting ^X^B to jump between buffers, the editor continued to display the 
previous file until I hit ^L.

My *guess* is that this was related to the volume of output to the listener...

thanx
