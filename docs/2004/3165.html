                <h1>Continuing grief with editor-pane in LWM</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

I've attached a bit of code that does the following:
-- creates a new interface called 'toy' that has a list and an editor  
pane
-- the list has a call back that changes the text in the editor
-- exports a function called play:toy that runs the interface

There is a function called 'toy-redisplay' that redisplays the editor  
in its own thread using the technique from  
&lt;http://www1.xanalys.com/support/lisp/kbase.nsf/ 
51fe6e1cdfe748a180256639005a2ba9/12e133730edbe13980256ea9004e2448? 
OpenDocument&gt

There is a function called 'add-text' that adds an item to the list,  
selects it and sets the editor text.

There is a function called 'play' that adds four items and displays  
everything.

When I run it (i.e. (toy:play) selecting items in the card list will  
update the text in the editor-pane. This is how I expect it to work.

HOWEVER...

If you uncomment the resize-callback for the editor, recompile and run,  
it stops working, but in a very strange way: The editor pane is not  
updated but the underlying buffer *is* updated (change tabs in the  
IDE's editor and select the toy buffer and watch it change as you click  
in the list). NOTE the resize callback has not been called, though if  
you do resize the window it will be.

Any help would be appreciated. What happens on other platforms?

Cheers,
Bob

It seems like a bug to me. I tried a few things and could not find a 
way to make it work. It would not even work if you use :resize-callback 
nil.

Also, it seems like a bug to me if you have to call editor:redisplay 
after using (setf editor-pane-text).

Best,

                 <h1>Re: Continuing grief with editor-pane in LWM [SOLVED]</h1>
                 <pre>Hi,

I reported this as a bug, and Martin Simmons of LispWorks support got  
back to me with the cause of the problem: the editor-pane has a default  
resize-callback that must be called. I tried defining an  
INITIALIZE-INSTANCE method on my interface, but this seems to be too  
early for this to work (the editor pane slot was not defined yet). As  
it happens, I use a single function to create the interface, so I added  
the following code there, and it works.


(let ((default-resize-callback (output-pane-resize-callback (editor  
window))))
       (labels ((extended-editor-resize (ed x y w h)
                  (apply default-resize-callback (list ed x y w h))
                  (let* ((fw (system::ed-font-width ed))
                         (pw (system::ed-pane-width ed))
                         (cw (truncate (/ pw fw)))
                         (ff (- cw 2))
                         #+nil(text (editor-pane-text ed)))
                    (setf (editor-pane-fixed-fill ed) ff))))
         (setf (output-pane-resize-callback (editor window))
               #'extended-editor-resize)))

So that's solved.

Now. What this bit of code does is calculate how many characters fit on  
a line in the editor and set the fixed-fill accordingly. It works. It  
does seem to me that there should be an easier way to do this though.

Cheers,
Bob
