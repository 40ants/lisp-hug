<P><FONT SIZE=2>Hi Dmitri,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>thanks for your answer. Please find my comments below.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;| I can imagine two possible solutions:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;| 1. Redirecting the click event. Then the button will never see the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;| event and the enclosing window can handle it.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;|</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;| 2. putting a pane with transparent background over the whole window.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;| Then all events should go to that pane and can be handled there.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;| Is one of this solutions possible ?</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;| Are there other solutions for that problem ?</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;| The application is MS-Windows only and doesn't need to be portable.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;| However, a portable solution is obviously prefered.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;The first may be possible with lots of Win32 API hacking around.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Yes, i would need to change the wndProc of the enclosing window or</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>(more brute-force) hang into the Get-Message/dispatch-message loop</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>and catch all events in question.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;The second is hardly possible since CAPI seems not to support </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;transparent background or superimposing widgets.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>I'm able to overlay widgets in a grid-layout by another grid-layout</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>(the trick is that capi seems to draw the :content from the last to the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;first entry). Then maybe (?) i can set the drawing mode to Transparent.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>But i would still need the WindowsHandle of the overlayed window. Is there</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>a way to get this ?</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;The prettiest solution would be drawing by hand everything </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;(including the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;button) on an output-pane. You could also investigate the </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;possibility to put</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;the button inside a pinboard-layout though this would suffers </FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;some of the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>&gt;flaws you have mentioned above.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The problem here is that for some widget i don't know how they look</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>(i.e. a text field may have arbitrary text and scroll positions).</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>I would need to blit the window into an off-screen buffer and then</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>create a new window with a &quot;picture&quot; of the original one :-(</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=2>Is this possible at all in CAPI ?</FONT>

                 <pre>Hello Andreas,

|&gt The second is hardly possible since CAPI seems not to support 
|&gt transparent background or superimposing widgets. 
| I'm able to overlay widgets in a grid-layout by another grid-layout 
| (the trick is that capi seems to draw the :content from the last to the
| first entry). Then maybe (?) i can set the drawing mode to Transparent.
| But i would still need the WindowsHandle of the overlayed window. Is
| there a way to get this ? 

Sorry, I've never tried.

|&gt The prettiest solution would be drawing by hand everything 
|&gt (including the 
|&gt button) on an output-pane. You could also investigate the 
|&gt possibility to put 
|&gt the button inside a pinboard-layout though this would suffers 
|&gt some of the 
|&gt flaws you have mentioned above. 
| The problem here is that for some widget i don't know how they look 
| (i.e. a text field may have arbitrary text and scroll positions). 
| I would need to blit the window into an off-screen buffer and then 
| create a new window with a "picture" of the original one :-( 
| Is this possible at all in CAPI ? 

It should be with Win32 hacking involved.
