                <pre>We use the IDE on Windows. I've found it to be finest development
environment I've used since my Symbolics days. That's my opinion, of course,
but I stand by it.

Cheers, David

Hi,

How do you folks actually use LispWorks on a day-to-day basis?

                 <h1>Re: How do people actually develop code using LispWorks</h1>
                 <pre>I really like the IDE and use it on all platform (and I am a die hard 
Emacs user, and past ILISP maintainer)

I just wish there were a few things in it that I have in Emacs.  
"Dired" is the thing I miss the most (of course you can now say: why 
don't you write it? :) )

Cheers

Marco

I miss a good CVS tool like PCL-CVS in emacs. However, I always have
a *cvs* buffer in my gnuemacs, so juming between LW and emacs for
cvs operations is really of very low cost to me.
