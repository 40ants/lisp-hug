                <h1>profiling</h1>
                <pre>
I'm experienceing performance anxiety with regards to my program
(a CAPI application)'s redisplay code.  Near as I can tell from the 
LispWorks Users Manual section about the profiler, profiling occurs
within the scope of the function PROFILE, which presents the results
when it exits.

I don;t see how this would work for profiling a redisplay callback
where I'd want to aggregate results over several minutes of application
use and am not running the code to be profiled from an interactive lisp
listener.

Anyone had experience with this?

It's been a year since I tried something similar - so my recollection might be 
hazy (even more than usual :-).

The graphical Profiler tool has buttons for customizing "symbols" and 
"packages" that are tracked by the profiler.  I think that I played with 
those settings to zero in on the functions I was most interested in, then ran 
my UI by invoking it in the ";; Insert code to profile." textbox.  In other 
words, I wrapped the profiler around the whole application, but told it to 
record only the handful of functions that were meaningful to me.

Hope this helps...
