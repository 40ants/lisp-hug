                <h1>How to avoid siteinit and init in shell file?</h1>
                <pre>I'm trying to use a GUI-less LispWorks image on OS X for processing 
shell files. I made an image with :environment nil, and saved it as 
"lispworks-console" in my local bin directory.

If I type this to a shell:

/Users/stoney/bin/lispworks-console -siteinit - -init -

LispWorks starts up with no loading of the siteinit or init files.

If I have a shell file (test-shell) that starts with:

#!/Users/stoney/bin/lispworks-console -siteinit - -init -

and run it (./test-shell)

LispWorks does load the siteinit and the default init files.

Why? How can I avoid this? sys:*line-arguments-list* contains the right 
arguments in both cases, although when run from the shell file, there 
is an additional item which is the shell-file name. This is good, of 
course.

Also, to what stream do the load messages get written? I'd like to 
eliminate them when running a lisp shell script.

TIA,

  - Stoney

                 <h1>Re: How to avoid siteinit and init in shell file?</h1>
                 <pre>I have found the answer. when invoking a program on the #! line, all 
the text after the program name is passed as a single argument.

I've also found that setting *load-verbose* to nil stops most of the 
text printed by load, but not all of it.

So, does anyone know if there's a way to invoke LispWorks via command 
line and without saying "-siteinit - -init -", avoid the loading of 
those files?

TIA,

  - Stoney
