                <h1>(defmacro ... &amp;environment env)</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

I have a question concerning the usage of the &amp;environment arg, in 
order to find out about the kind of the var that is passed to the macro 
(print-var-kind &lt;var&gt).

I succeed in finding out, if it is :lexical, :special or 
:assumed-special, only the last run of (test4 5) doesn't work. I would 
like to see in the result that the variable is :lexical, or even better 
:shadowed.

But it seems that the data I find in the  "venv" of the environment 
does not allow me to make this distinction between test1 and test4.

On the other hand, test5 correctly detects the shadowing and identifies 
a to :lexical, since in the venv list (stack?) there are two entries 
for a. The function var-kind could easily be extended to identify it as 
:shadowed.

Well, again unfortunately this does not work for global special vars!
I probably should not dare to write this, but is it really correct that 
in the case of test4, x is considered special? What I am I missing to 
find out better??

I hope I have expressed myself clearly enough, I am not a 
computer-scientist.... Please tell me, if you need more detailed 
information.

Thanks anyway for listening,

	Peter

This is my code:

(defun find-var-in-env (name env)
   (find name (slot-value env 'compiler::venv)
         :key #'(lambda (venv) (slot-value venv 'compiler::name))))

(defun var-kind (name env)
   (let ((info (find-var-in-env name env)))
     (values
      (if (null info)
          :assumed-special
        (if (slot-value info 'compiler::specialp)
            :special
          :lexical))
      info)))

(defmacro print-var-kind (var &amp;environment env)
   (let ((var-kind (var-kind var env)))
     `(progn
        (format t "~s: ~s" ',var ,var-kind)
        ,var)))

(defvar x 3) ; one might forget to name it *x*...

(defun test1 (a)
   "a is lexicall"
   (print-var-kind a))

(defun test2 ()
   "x is declared special"
   (declare (special x))
   (print-var-kind x))

(defun test3 ()
   "x is assumed special"
   (print-var-kind x))

(defun test4 (x)
   "x is special, but shadowed lexically"
   (print-var-kind x))

(defun test5 ()
   (let (a)
     (declare (special a))
     (let ((a 100))
       (print-var-kind a))))

There's a subtle distinction between shadowing a variable and dynamically
binding a variable.

It's first important to distinguish between the name of a variable,
the variable itself, and the current place where its value is stored.

Variables are named by lisp symbols.  Those symbols are not themselves 
the variables, but merely serve to name them.

At any given point in the code the compiler (or interpreter) knows
where the value of any given variable is stored.  This location might
be a register, on the stack or in memory.

When a symbol naming a non-special variable appears in a new binding 
context (e.g. as a LET variable or in the formal parameters of a function), 
that variable shadows other variables of the same name while lexically 
within that binding context.  Within the lexical context that name will
refer to that variable unless also within a narrower lexical context in 
which the variable is shadowed.

When a symbol naming a special variable appears in a binding context, 
it establishes a new dynamic binding for that same variable.

When a variable is shadowed, that means that there's some other variable 
with the same name which will be found instead when the compiler (or
interpreter) looks for a variable by that name.  The shadowing variable 
and the shadowed variable are different variables even though they are
named by the same lisp symbol.

When a variable is dymanically bound (as in TEST4), that means that a 
new container for storing the value of that variable has been associated
with that variable and this association will persist for, and no longer 
than, the extent of that dynamic ebvironment.


I don't know that I've explained it all that well, but I hope it's 
helpful.
