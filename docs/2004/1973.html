[snip]
&gt&gt   There is support in SLIME for LispWorks on Linux;
&gt&gt    however, the commands that are used to start up a socket
communication on
&gt&gt    LW under Linux don't exist on the MS Windows version of LW. The
specific
&gt&gt    functions that are missing are:
&gt&gt
&gt&gt    SYSTEM:SET-SIGNAL-HANDLER
&gt&gt    SYSTEM::GETPID
[snip]
&gt In LispWorks for Windows you can get the process id by calling the
&gt Win32 API GetCurrentProcessId. Conveniently, there's already a Lisp
&gt function WIN32:GET-CURRENT-PROCESS-ID though that's
&gt undocumented.
&gt
&gt There's no equivalent of SYS:SET-SIGNAL-HANDLER, because Windows
&gt doesn't have signals.

Thanks - that's what I was after!

&gt BTW, I expect you'll need to use a console LispWorks image, as for
&gt ILISP.

Unfortunately, that is not an option on the LW Personal edition.

With the info you gave me, I've been able to get SLIME working with LW
on Windows. I'll be submitting a patch to the SLIME developers shortly.

Thanks,
Bill Clementson
