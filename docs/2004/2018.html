                <h1>buffer to window</h1>
                <pre>I have a capi interface with an editor pane. When an editor command is 
executed I have the buffer from which I would like to get my top level 
interface instance. I don't see simple way to do this. I thought 
something like this might work:

(defun buffer-window (buffer)
   (let ((win (first (editor::buffer-windows buffer)))) ; 
(editor:current-window) does not seem to work outside the built-in 
editor
     (when win
       (capi:editor-window (editor:window-text-pane win)))))

But this returns a window of type editor::wm-window, not my capi 
interface window.

Thanks for any suggestions,

John DeSoi, Ph.D.
