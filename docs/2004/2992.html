                <h1>startup image wrapped around</h1>
                <pre>Greetings,

As an experiment to use the :STARTUP-BITMAP-FILE keyword, I created an 
indexed-color BMP image with GIMP and delivered a program with it.  When 
my program was launched, I got a wrapped-around image in the splash screen.
Please take a look at http://chi-square-works.com/weird-sw.html for an
example.  Does anybody know how to get around this problem?  

Best wishes,

-cph

The fact that there have been 16 persons taking a look at the above URL
and I got no reply on this yet led me to suspect GIMP might be the problem.
To see if my guess was right or not, I created a new BMP image from an XPM
image with xpmtoppm and ppmtobmp on a Linux box.  This time, the image was
displayed correctly in the splash window.  Thank you to all the 16 persons
who took time to view the URL.

Best,
