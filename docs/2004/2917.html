                <h1>TCP timeout</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

I'm having some trouble with getting a TCP connection to timeout on 
connect.  My understanding is that the following function should return 
Nil after 3 seconds:

(comm:open-tcp-stream "1.0.0.3" 3999 direction :io :read-timeout 3)

However, the :read-timeout keyword seems to have no effect on how long 
it attempts to connect. For me it takes somewhere around 1 minute 
before it times out. I'm using LWM.

Is this an error, or am I missing something about the specs for this 
function?

Thanks,

-Chris

As far as I understand the documentation, the :read-timeout that you 
specify is only used after the connection is made within the resulting 
stream for read operations. I have not yet tested this in practice 
though. Maybe there should be something like a :connect-timeout as 
well. I can imagine lots of situations where you would want this (to 
increase application reliability, ui responsiveness, etc...)

I think the undocumented keyword :timeout that does this, but
maybe someone from Xanalys should comment on if you can use it
safely. Seems to be doing its work for me.
