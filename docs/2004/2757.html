                <h1>Two MOP usage questions</h1>
                <pre>Hi!

I'm relatively new to the MOP so my apologies if these are dumb questions. I
have the AMOP book and have skimmed through it but I have to admit that -
due to lack of time - I didn't read the whole stuff about how a metaobject
protocol could be implemented. If I'm missing something obvious which can be
found in this book just name chapter and verse and I'll read it.

Question 1: I want to create classes and methods programmatically at
runtime. It seems to me as if it's not the right thing to bury macros like
DEFCLASS or DEFMETHOD within function bodies as these belong at the
top-level. Is that the right approach, i.e. is it better to use the
functions ENSURE-CLASS and ADD-METHOD instead?

Question 2: I wanted to do the equivalent of

  (defmethod foo ((n integer) &amp;rest other-args)
    (apply #'+ n other-args))

and my first approach was this:

  (use-package :clos)

  (add-method (ensure-generic-function 'foo)
              (make-instance 'standard-method
                             :specializers (list (find-class 'integer))
                             :lambda-list '(n &amp;rest other-args)
                             :function #'(lambda (n &amp;rest other-args)
                                           (apply #'+ n other-args))))

However, this doesn't work because if I call FOO like, say, (FOO 1 2 3) then
OTHER-ARGS in the method function will be ((2 3)) instead of (2 3).

This variation does work:

  (use-package :clos)

  (add-method (ensure-generic-function 'foo)
              (make-instance 'standard-method
                             :specializers (list (find-class 'integer))
                             :lambda-list '(n &amp;rest other-args)
                             :function #'(lambda (n other-args)
                                           (apply #'+ n other-args))))

Am I correct in assuming that the method function get its arguments kind of
"pre-processed," i.e. with the &amp;REST, &amp;OPTIONAL, and &amp;KEY stuff already
taken care of? Is this detailed somewhere?

Thanks in advance,
Edi.

In general, DEFCLASS and DEFMETHOD should work when they are not at the 
top level. However, you probably want to have their effect depend on 
runtime properties, so this probably won't get you very far. On the 
other hand, ENSURE-CLASS and ADD-METHOD are somewhat complicated to 
use, so I suggest to first try the former and only switch to the latter 
when you actually need them. In other words, as soon as you feel 
compelled to say (EVAL `(DEFXYZ ... ,(some-runtime-property) ...)), you 
should switch to the MOP.

ANSI specifies the effects of DEFCLASS, DEFMETHOD and the likes when 
they are not at the top level. Essentially, it specifies that there is 
no guarantee with regard to compile-time effects.

Yes, this is part of the MOP specification. Usually, you don't create a 
function directly with LAMBDA, but rather use the MOP's 
MAKE-METHOD-LAMBDA. Check out the section about "Processing of the User 
Interface Macros" in AMOP, especially "The defmethod Macro" and 
"Processing Method Bodies". This gives you a pretty good idea what you 
need to do to create your own methods at run time. LispWorks deviates 
with regard to the parameters a method lambda receives. This is 
documented in Section 11.1 of the LispWorks User Guide.

At first, the separation into ADD-METHOD and MAKE-METHOD-LAMBDA 
appeared strange and unnecessary to me. However, this separation is 
necessary in order to process lexical environments correctly. In the 
most general case, you would need something like the ENCLOSE function 
defined in CLtL2 (but dropped in ANSI). LispWorks defines ENCLOSE - 
it's not documented but seems to work.

I hope this helps.

Yes, I forgot to mention that. If I were to use the macros I would
definitely need to use EVAL so that was another reason to investigate
the functions instead.

What could that be? Anything to worry about?

Argh! I had read that the other day but skipped parts of it because I
thought it wouldn't apply in my case... :(

&gt LispWorks deviates with regard to the parameters a method lambda
&gt receives. This is documented in Section 11.1 of the LispWorks User
&gt Guide.

Hmm, I wouldn't really call that "documented," though. I haven't found
a place where it is actually specified what parameters LispWorks'
MAKE-METHOD-LAMBDA takes and in which order. I inspected
#'MAKE-METHOD-LAMBDA in the IDE and from what I saw there I came up
with this (FIXNUM declaration just inserted while experimenting):

  (let ((generic-function (ensure-generic-function 'foo)))
    (make-method-lambda
     generic-function
     (class-prototype (generic-function-method-class generic-function))
     '(n &amp;rest other-args)
     '(fixnum n)
     '(progn (print 'howdy)
             (apply #'+ n other-args))))
                                                 
Does that look right?

I think the last (BODY) parameter (except for the optional environment
argument) has to be wrapped in PROGN if it's more than one form
although LispWorks will wrap another PROGN around it anyway. Hmm...

Now to get the behaviour from my original example I tried this which
seems to work:

  (let ((generic-function (ensure-generic-function 'foo)))
    (add-method generic-function
                (make-instance 'standard-method
                   :specializers (list (find-class 'integer))
                   :lambda-list '(n &amp;rest other-args)
                   :function (compile nil (make-method-lambda
                                           generic-function
                                           (class-prototype
                                            (generic-function-method-class
                                             generic-function))
                                           '(n &amp;rest other-args)
                                           nil
                                           '(apply #'+ n other-args))))))

However, there's another question popping up:

In the MOP book (figure 5.3) they use FUNCTION instead of COMPILE
which doesn't seem to work. Do I have to use COMPILE (and thus invoke
the compiler at runtime) if I want my methods to be compiled? I had
hoped that I could create them like closures such that they are
compiled at compile time.

&gt At first, the separation into ADD-METHOD and MAKE-METHOD-LAMBDA
&gt appeared strange and unnecessary to me. However, this separation is
&gt necessary in order to process lexical environments correctly. In the
&gt most general case, you would need something like the ENCLOSE
&gt function defined in CLtL2 (but dropped in ANSI). LispWorks defines
&gt ENCLOSE - it's not documented but seems to work.

So if I don't have lexical environments to care about I can just leave
the environment parameter out, right?

&gt I hope this helps.

This helped a lot, thanks! I'm still not fully getting it, though. I'd
be happy if I could look at some working examples somewhere. How did
you come up with this stuff, especially the parts which are specific
to LispWorks? Did you use trial and error or am I missing something in
the docs?

Thanks again,
Edi.

So I thought I should look at your AspectL package. And, yes,
MAKE-METHOD-LAMBDA is used there. I'll see if this'll enlighten me.
