Hi Dave

&gt 1. I noticed one mistake in your code: you're calling GP:DRAW-STRING
&gt in the wrong process. Does the problem still occur for you when you
&gt redefine FINISH-EDIT like this:
&gt
&gt (defun finish-edit (intf)
&gt   (declare (ignore intf))
&gt   (let* ((buff (editor:buffer-from-name "junk"))
&gt          (str (editor:points-to-string
&gt               (editor:buffers-start buff)
&gt               (editor:buffers-end buff))))
&gt     (hcl:clean-down)
&gt     (capi:execute-with-interface *intf*
&gt 				 'gp:draw-string
&gt 				 (canvas *intf*) str 50 50)))

Yes, the problem still occurs.  I've attached the modified code so that you
might check to see that I didn't botch the modification. :-)

&gt 2. What does the GC monitor show
&gt  a) during the small pause?

I believe that it says "Running".  It happens quickly, so I am not absolutely
certain.  I've seen 3 things in that spot today - "Running", "Idle", "GC".
During the small pause, the message is definitely of longer length than
"Idle" (leaving "Running" as the only possibility).

&gt  b) when the capi:editor-pane hangs?

"Idle", but flickers to "Running" once or twice a second.

This is definitely different behaviour from the normal Idle state when there
is no hanging editor (where "Idle" appears steadily, no flicker).

&gt 3. What exactly does the "Text Editor" window look like when the
&gt    capi:editor-pane remains hanging?

Exactly as "I left it" when I moved the mouse over to the "x" button, i.e.
 the contents of the editor are still there.

I can move and resize the frame, but the white inside pane does not resize
itself.  If I resize the frame, before it hangs, then the inside pane does
resize itself (as expected).

I can continue to type characters into the hung editor.  The "x" button works
(visually), but the window does not close.

&gt 4. In the case that the "Text Editor" window closes successfully, what
&gt    actually goes wrong when you close the "Hanging Editor Bug" window?

This case happened only once today (see (7) below - suggestion to add more
clean-downs).

I got a condition where I'd spun up more than one editor (one editor for each
key-click on the output pane).  I closed the editors while the thing was
still GC'ing.

The output pane was completely empty and would not close.  You could resize
its frame, but the innards did not resize.

&gt 5. Is there any unusual output at the terminal, such as GC messages (lines
&gt    starting with "&lt;**&gt" ) ?

Nothing in the listener.  Nothing in the Output window (tab in Listener).
[Those are the windows you meant by "terminal", yes?].


6. New observations:

When the editor hangs, KDE in general becomes very slow.  The main menu (the
equivalent of the Start button on Windows - don't know what they call it in
Linux :-) takes many seconds to respond to a mouse click (whereas it is
usually instantaneous).

I ran XLoad and watched it when the editor hung.  In "idle", Xload was showig
approx 15%.  Soon after the hang, it spiked to 30% then drifted back to about
20%.

7. AHA!

I found a pattern that makes the bug quite repeatable.  I touch-type and am
quite used to "typing ahead".

If I type space-^A-^K-asdf while the GC monitor is still showing activity
 from the previous edit, I get the hang "every time".

Here's the procedure that forces a hang on the 3rd edit:

a) compile-and-load ed2.lisp

b) (run)

c) click on output pane for focus

d) hit space-bar

e) editor opens, ^X^Fjunk, type in ^A^Kasdf

f) click "x"

g) let everything settle down and "asdf" to appear on output pane

h) hit space bar, editor opens

i) now move the output pane window and the edit window so that the
 upper-right corner of the editor is over the middle of the output pane
 window - this sets you up to quickly type ahead on the next round

j) hit ^A^Kasdf in the editor

k) now, do all of these in rapid succession: (i) click the "x" (close) button
on the editor, (ii) click mouse in output pane for focus, (iii) hit space
bar, (iv) type ^A^Kasdf

l) if you were fast enough, you will have finished sequence (k) before the
output window re-displays the previous "asdf".  When I finish (k), I can
still see GC/Idle flicker in the GC monitor.  When it catches up to you and
opens the editor again, you should see a slight pause before it reacts to the
^A^K (which was typed ahead).

m) Click the "x" close button of the editor.  It should do "nothing".  The
editor hangs.

The trick is to position the windows as in (i) so that you can hit the left
mouse button twice (once to "x" the editor, once to regain focus in output
pane), then to quickly type in the rest of the sequence.

Hmm, you might be able to exacerbate the problem by doing clean-down more
 than once.

Thanks
