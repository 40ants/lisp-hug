                 <pre>&gt  &gt screen for a whopping 30 seconds.  Is there any way to make
&gt  &gt the startup image disappear right after my program has finished
&gt  &gt the startup process?  
&gt
&gt Is this a CAPI application?

No, it's not.  Thanks.

                 <pre>&gt    CAPI:PROMPT-FOR-FILE is implemented by a native Windows file
&gt    dialog, and this does not make the startup image disappear like
&gt    CAPI:DISPLAY-DIALOG. Perhaps it should.
&gt
&gt Aye, and it's not the only native Windows dialog in the system. 
&gt
&gt Is there a call we can make ourselves, to tear down the splashscreen?

Some way for us (not using CAPI) to rid of the startup image would be
great.  I really don't want to give my users the misimpression that 
my program takes 30 seconds to start up.  One bonus of this functionality
is that I do not have to wait for 30 seconds to start debugging after an 
explosion in "lispworks -siteinit - -init save-something.lisp" :)

Best,
