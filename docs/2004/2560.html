                <h1>editor eval bug?</h1>
                <pre>I'm running LW OS X 4.3.7

Into a buffer, try putting the following

(defun foo (bar)
   "doc string"
   ;; quotation mark "
   nil)

and place the cursor at the end of the expression, and C-X C-E (to eval exp).
In my minibuffer I see, "Cannot find start of the form to evaluate".
Removing the
quotation mark from the comment makes everything fine again. 

But still, these quotes in the comments do get matched up. In
(defun baz (bar)
  "doc string"
  ;; quotation mark "
  nil)

(defun foo (bar)
  "doc string"
  ;; quotation mark "
  nil)

I can C-X C-E at the end of foo (not baz though), and the expression goes though
just fine.

Evidentally, parentheses in doc strings are not immune either

(defun baz (bar)
  "doc string("
  nil)

(defun foo (bar)
  "doc string"
  ;; quotation mark "
  nil)

C-X C-E on foo gives an outright error (popup dialog and all) saying
Illegal argument in functor position: "
  nil)

(defun foo (bar)
  " in ("
  nil)

(defun foo (bar)
  " Doc String "
  ;; quotation mark " Nil).

This isn't a big deal (at least not for me; I try to keep everything
matched anyhow),
espially seeing as how "Evaluate Buffer" still works, and so does loading, but 
I didn't see this in the knowledgebase of known bugs, but it wasn't
the sort of thing
that generates a backtraceable error or anything like it either. Hope
it's of interest to
someone.
