                <h1>pinboard layout inside pinboard layout?</h1>
                <pre>Is it possible to have a pinboard layout inside of another pinboard layout
(and have it function properly)  I've gotten the layouts to show up, but I
get all sorts of odd behaviours.  Is there perhaps some way that I could
get similar functionality without a pinboard layout or something???

                 <h1>Re: pinboard layout inside pinboard layout?</h1>
                 <pre>More specifically, I think I've found this to be a bug in lw-osx(10.3)

To recreate this bug, load up the balloons example in 
examples/capi/applications and execute
(capi:contain (make-instance 'capi:pinboard-layout :description (list 
(make-instance 'sky))))

Then try to resize the window... you'll notice that the sky pane sticks 
to the bottom of the window, but then try to click a balloon... you'll 
find that you are only able to click the balloons if your press the area 
where the balloons *would have been* had the sky pane remained at the 
top of the window as it should have.  Seemingly, the resizing of the 
window is causing the pinboard layout to be displayed in the wrong place 
even though it is still considered to be in the upper left hand of the 
screen.  Is this a known bug and if so, is there a workaround??  (this 
applies to any time you have a pinboard object with a pinboard object, 
not just the balloons example.

I've tried the same thing on windows and the darwin/x11 version and they 
both work properly... perhaps this is an issue with lw on 10.3.
