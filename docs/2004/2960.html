                <h1>Trivial Sockets</h1>
                <pre>Yesterday, I contributed a LispWorks implementation to Daniel Barlow's 
Trivial Sockets project,
a thin compatibility layer for simple client and server socket use.

You can read more about it here: http://www.cliki.net/trivial-sockets

The LispWorks implementation has the following limitations (quoted from 
the manual):

LispWorks supports TCP only,  It doesn't do
non-default local address in server sockets, or listen backlog length.
It doesn't do non-default external-formats.  If the local port is 0,
open-server doesn't return the real port number.  It also uses
an odd construction involving multiple threads for server sockets
which in principle should be transparent but don't say we didn't warn
you.

I tried to use only features documented in the manuals, because I 
wanted the implementation to work on all LispWorks platforms, not just 
on Mac OS X. But I noticed that there are more arguments to some of the 
comm functions than are documented, and I know from this mailing list 
and other projects that even more *is* possible in LispWorks.

If anyone is interested in this project and/or wants to make sure that 
there is a good LispWorks implementation, please feel free to look at 
the code and suggest improvements.

Version 0.3 will bring timeout support, which we talked about here some 
time ago.

Sven

The acl-compat code which comes with portable-aserve works around many
of the limitations in the Lispworks public interface.  The file to
look at is "portableaserve/acl-compat/lispworks/acl-socket.lisp".

For example, I wanted to try to open a server socket on a particular
port, and then try another if the address was already in use.  This
was difficult to achieve using the Lispworks public interface, but
easy using 'make-socket', available in acl-compat.

Unfortunately, I do not have the enthusiasm to actually write the
necessary compatibility code for "Trivial Sockets", which seems to be
the third portable socket interface, after acl-compat and clocc.

Why are these two libraries insufficient?

Download this for socket access:

there the link Unix domain sockets
