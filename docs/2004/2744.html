                 foreign type (:POINTER :WCHAR-T)</h1>
                <pre>If I have a foreign function FOO defined like this

(fli:define-foreign-function
    (foo "Foo")
  ((ptr :pointer)
   (type (:pointer :wchar-t)))
  :result-type :void)

and call it like this

(defun bar (object type)
  (fli:with-foreign-string (type-name element-count byte-count 
                                      :external-format :unicode)
    type
    (declare (ignore element-count byte-count))
    (foo (get-pointer object)
         type-name))
  object)

with TYPE being a string I get an error message:

Error: #&lt;Pointer to type FLI::WCHAR-T = #x003F6E70&gt cannot be converted to
foreign type (:POINTER :WCHAR-T).

I can circumvent this by changing the definition of FOO to 

(fli:define-foreign-function
    (foo "Foo")
  ((ptr :pointer)
   (type :pointer))
  :result-type :void)

but I don't understand what's wrong with the first definition. What's the
difference between a

  #&lt;Pointer to type FLI::WCHAR-T = #x003F6E70&gt

and a (:POINTER :WCHAR-T)?

I thought that WITH-FOREIGN-STRING with the appropriate external format is
supposed to create a (:POINTER :WCHAR-T)...

Thanks,
Edi.

According to the FLI docs (4.2.2) this will only work if I "can bound

for my application.

It looks to me as if I have to use something like the third example
from 4.2.2 and you use :POINTER there, too, so maybe I should just do
it.

&gt Why did you think that?

The receiving C++ function expects a pointer to wchar_t and LispWorks
creates something internally that it calls a "Pointer to
FLI::WCHAR-T." I don't think it is too far-fetched from me to see a
similarity between these two things and (:POINTER :WCHAR-T).

Anyway, I'll just use :POINTER.

Sorry to drag this old post up again, but I have encountered some similar 
problems.
I also opted for the "just use :POINTER" approach - which seems to work..

I am using one of those Windows API calls where the first call tells you 
how big the buffer needs to be to hold the answer.
Then you call it again with the right size buffer to get the answer you 
really wanted in the first place.

The code is below.
As in the original post, it is modeled on the third example from FLI Manual 
4.2.2 Modifying a string in a C function.

I had to use :wchar-t to get it to work with Unicode pathnames on XP.
This does not tie up with Dave's comment that "I have never seen a use for 
:wchar-t "
Is this a valid use of :wchar-t ? or is there a better way to do this ?

Any insights appreciated.

Thanks
