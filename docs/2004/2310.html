                <h1>Single-table joins and the OO interface</h1>
                <pre>I have a view class on a database table, say something like:

(def-view-class frodo-view (...) ((code ...)...)
  (:base-table frodo))

In the db there are pairs of frodos, identifier by 'code, that I want to
find. In functional sql, I can write this and have it work:

(sql:select ["t1" code] ["t2" code] :from '([frodo "t1"] [frodo "t2"])
:where [and [= ["t1" code] "00100"] [= ["t2" code] "93701"]])

But, I can't figure out how to reference my view class in the query rather
than using this lower level stuff; as in this incorrect phrasing:

(sql:select ["t1" code] ["t2" code] :from '([frodo-view "t1"] [frodo-view
"t2"])
 ...)

I'd appreciate some assistance. Thanks...

I have just been doing ["t1.code"].  Works fine.

Better make sure you're in ANSI SQL mode on your database, because the view class
layer gets pretty unhappy if you're not (with MySQL anyway).

Try turning on SQL recording so you can see what is being sent to the DB.
