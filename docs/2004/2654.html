                <h1>KW: invoking findall from predicate</h1>
                <pre>Greetings. In our expert system we have some forward-chaining rules that
invoke predicates, via the TEST CE, that in turn apply some backchaining
goals via the functions ANY and FINDALL. These rules are exhibiting
non-deterministic behavior over the same data set, and I've tracked down the
cause to these predicates. If I replace these predicates with actual
instances reprenting the conditions defined by the predicates, the system
behaves properly.

Is there a restriction in KW that prohibits the predicate approach I've
described here? Clearly, predicates that do not invoke the backchainer are
not an issue. I don't want to get into why we chose this approach, but
suffice it to say it seemed to fit our environment nicely.

Hi,

I don't know of any such restriction. If there is a bug in KW then you 
are probably going to have to boil down the code to a small reproducible 
example or mail some of the source to see if we can eyeball the bug in 
the application.
