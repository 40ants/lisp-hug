                <pre>That's what I'm doing right now; a simple binary protocol for our clos
objects. Please mail me your serialization library thought, I'd love to take
a look. Thanks much!

Cheers, David

&gt Sounds as if you hit an internal limit in the fasl loader. See the

I started that thread. I solved my problem by writing my own serializer &amp;
deserializer that assumes non-circularity as the default. That means that
it doesn't need to be as general as the FASL-dumper.

It worked quite well for my application: I got rid of the "pig in the
snake" symptom, where memory use increases enormously while creating and
dumping all the load forms and then goes back to normal again. Speed was
also much better (a factor of 10 or 20, IIRC) than the FASL-dumper.

That may be related to the amount of 'cross references' in the data.
An array of floats may be easier to dump than a graph, for example.

If you're interested in my serialization library, I can mail it to you.
There's also something called CL-STORE on common-lisp.net that you may
want to look at.
