                <h1>Change-callback in rich-text-pane on LWM4.4</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

I'm trying to use the rich-text-pane in LWM4.4 but cannot seem to get 
the change-callback to work. I've appended some code.

I'm assuming that this callback is supposed to be called whenever a 
change is made to the editor. So try typing into the editor. No 
callback is made.

I had a problem with the resize callback in the editor-pane. In that 
case there was a default resize callback that I had to ensure was 
called, then things worked. In this case, the documentation says the 
default callback is nil. I verified this by not setting the callback 
and checking if it was defined.

Can anybody see what I've done wrong?

Some notes:
1) I'm changing the parameter *rtf-ed-change* rather than using 
something like format in case the IO streams are not right (see the 
release notes for OS/X, no idea if this applies here, but just in case)
2) there are two ways of setting the callback: by init arg, by 
accessor. There are functions defined in the test code for both.


Thanks,
Bob

; set this parameter in the callback in case the the IO streams are 
wrong

    (editor rich-text-pane
            :text "The RTF Editor"
            :reader editor
            :horizontal-scroll nil
            :vertical-scroll t
            ;:change-callback #'(lambda (pane &amp;key type) (format t 
"CHANGE ~S to ~S~%" type pane))
            :change-callback #'(lambda (&amp;rest args)

   (:default-initargs
    :title "RTF Editor"
    :layout 'main-layout
    :best-width 600
    :best-height 400))

          (ed (editor interface)))
     (display interface)
     (format t "The CHANGE-CALLBACK function: ~S~%" 
(rich-text-pane-change-callback ed))))

; execute this if you want to explicitly set the callback

          (ed (editor interface)))
     (display interface)

package...
