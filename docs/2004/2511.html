Two theoretical paths are:

(1) Java JNI -&gt LispWorks FLI (ie via C). You use javah to generate 
..c/.h files that define the Java interface and then use the LispWorks 
FLI generator to convert those into definitions you can call from Lisp. 
You probably have to write some extra glue code too. You have to load 
the JVM into LispWorks.

(2) Java-to-IDL -&gt IDL-to-Lisp (ie via CORBA). Unlike all other 
languages with a CORBA binding, Java has a reverse mapping to IDL 
(normally the mapping are from IDL to the language). So you could 
generate the IDL description of your Java interfaces and then use the 
IDL to generate Lisp code that will call that. You may also need to 
write some extra glue code.

PROs and CONs

(1) is more efficient

(2) would enable you to dynamically choose whether to load the JVM 
runtime into LispWorks or run it as a separate executable
(2) would enable you to run the processes remotely from each other on 
different machines
(2) would enable you to change the implementation language of either end 
more easily

                 <h1>RE: Foreign Function Calls to Java</h1>
                 <pre>I am nearing completion of jfli - a fairly extensive interface to Java from
LispWorks, which I intend to release as open source under the Common Public
License.

The approach I took was to embed a JVM instance in the Lisp process using
JNI. I was able to do this using LispWorks' own FLI and no C (or Java! *)
code, which is a tribute to the LW FLI. On top of the JNI layer (essentially
a wrapper around the entire JNI API), I built the user-level API using Java
reflection.

My objective was to provide comprehensive, safe, dynamic and Lisp-y access
to Java and Java libraries as if they were Lisp libraries, for use in Lisp
programs, i.e. an emphasis on working in Lisp rather than in Java.

jfli ("jay fly") provides:

Automatic function generation for constructors, fields and methods, either
by named class, or entire package (sub)trees given a jar file.

Java -&gt Lisp package and name mapping with an eye towards lack of surprise,
lack of conflict, and useful completion

setf-able setter generation for fields as well as for methods that follow
the JavaBeans property protocol

Java array creation and aref-like access to Java arrays

A 'new' macro that allows for keyword-style field and property
initialization.

Typed references to Java objects with an inheritance hierarchy on the Lisp
side mirroring that on the Java side - allowing for Lisp methods specialized
on Java class and interface types.

Implementation of arbitrary Java interfaces in Lisp, and callbacks from Java
to Lisp via those interfaces. (* this required a single 5-line dummy Java
proxy stub, provided with jfli)

Automatic lifetime maintenance of Lisp-referenced Java objects,
boxing/unboxing of primitive args/returns, string conversions, Java
exception handling, overload resolution etc.

I built jfli using LWM and LWW (using Apple's and Sun's JVMs respectively),
and it works fine on both. Should be a trivial port to other LispWorks, and
a possible port to any Common Lisp with a robust FLI. Should also work with
any JVM with a conformant JNI implementation.

This sounds really good. Sorry, but I have to ask... What do you think 
the timing is on this?

Do I understand what you are saying properly? LW using jfli starts a 
jvm, can create a bunch of objects, call methods on those objects, 
implement Java interfaces so can set up lisp handlers for callbacks in 
a gui say, or a web application, which themselves can call back into 
Java. What happens across invocations of the LW program -- lisp has an 
image which can be re-started, Java doesn't? Let me tell you, I'd be 
happy to have such problems :-)

I'm also curious what your intended use is for this... what problem are 
you trying to solve?

Cheers,
Bob

Yep, Lisp starts the JVM, you create objects, can fire up a GUI and receive
events. I've successfully called JDBC and SWT (some Mac hiccups, Windows OK)
so far. It can load any classes, as normally done in Java, so is not limited
to the core Java API.

Extending the Lisp image notion to Java is beyond the initial scope of the
project. For all the dynamism of Java class loading etc, the VM loading
support in JNI is fairly rigid (one JVM instance, no unloads, no restarts
etc). So Java is inferior to Lisp in that regard, but still useful.

What I'm trying to do is increase the practicality of Lisp (for me,
personally, I know it's quite powerful on its own), for a wide variety of
projects. I'm interested in SWT as a portable UI for Lisp (no slight to
CAPI, a very nice library); better integration with the outside world;
access to vast libraries of stuff I'd rather not roll on my own. 

I want to do more real-world work in Lisp and not spend a lot of time
wheel-reinventing while doing so. With jfli, Lisp will always have a library
that is a superset of Java's, and everyone working on libraries for Java is
working on libraries for Lisp.

This sounds wonderful! Have you considered applying for hosting at 
common-lisp.net? I'm sure they'd be interested in this project. CL.net 
is a great place to host CL code and offers more flexible VCS options 
(CVS, Arch, Darcs, etc).

This is similar to the situation I'm in. For the foreseeable future I 
can only consider a mixed Java and lisp environment -- my company has a 
quite large java code base that we cannot ignore. Jfli looks as though 
we could start using LW where it makes sense.

Any thoughts as to how to make lisp programs appear to java? For 
example, it might be interesting to dress up a lisp program as a 
servlet, or a bunch of servlets. Or simply to wrap it in a java class.

Dave (Fox), what do you and others at Xanalys think of this project? 
What about some of the lisp projects out there -- some of these would 
be more than a little interesting to the java community (personally, 
I'm thinking of Marc Battyani's cl-typesetting and cl-pdf).

Bob

                     <pre>To the extent LispWorks can create dynamic libraries on the desired platform
(I haven't used that feature myself yet) it should be very possible to call
Lisp from Java programs, i.e. where the JVM is started outside of jfli/Lisp.
One could create a Lisp DLL that implements a native Java method (jfli does
this to implement interface proxies). In this method you could (with an
as-yet-unwritten-but-trivial function) bind jfli to the JVM that called the
method. At that point all of jfli's functionality would become available to
the Lisp code. If the method returned an implementation of some sort of
factory interface, one could continue to use that from Java to create
Lisp-implemented objects. That's just one scenario.

If you wanted an out-of-proc connection I guess there's RMI as well as
XML-RPC and SOAP.

                  <pre>On 2004/06/23, Rich Hickey announced the pending
release of jfli, a comprehensive Lisp-y interface to
the Java Native Interface (JNI). Rich estimated jfli
will be in beta in a month. Thanks, Rich!

I need to commit to a direction before then, so I
wrote a minimal test bed to prove to myself that I can
meet my promises even if jfli is delayed for any
reason. This testbed is not a substitute for jfli in
any manner. I look forward eagerly to jfli's release.

If anyone is interested in a "sneak peek" at Java-Lisp
integration, you may download the code from:

http://199.234.154.207/jni-lisp.html

The code is tested in Lispworks for Windows. The Lisp
and Java code is portable. The C code, in c2lisp.c, is
Windows-specific but should easily be portable. The C
code is minimal. Only functions FillVMArgs and
Java_Lisp_callVoidPtrJstring are required. FillVMArgs
could be replaced with FLI calls from Lispworks.
Except for 3 lines of debug code,
Java_Lisp_callVoidPtrJstring is a 4-line function
enabling callbacks to Lisp from Java.
