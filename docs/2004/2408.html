                <h1>Lispworks/Linux-Motif customization</h1>
                <pre>    Hi all lispworkers,


Does anybody know
1) how to prevent the Control+Tab keychord in LW/Editor from switching 
focus (from editor-pane to echo-area-pane), and
2) how to rebind it to an built-in Editor command ?

(having developed the bad habit of binding C-Tab to 
indent-for-tab-comment in Emacs, I'm finding myself constantly shooting 
in the foot when doing that in LW/Editor :-))

I've tried to play a bit with Motif traversals, but with no success so 
far...

Thanks very much in advance,

P.S. : BTW, I've come up with a quite different (from the default) set 
of X resources for LW/Motif, that I happen to like more than the 
defaults. If anyone is interested, please feel free to ask.

(The LW i'm using is LW personal 4.3.6 for Linux)

   focus (from editor-pane to echo-area-pane), and

Ctrl+Tab is a standard Motif navigation gesture, which is hardwired
into the CAPI's Motif backend...

   2) how to rebind it to an built-in Editor command ?

.... so such a binding will have no effect: X/Motif grabs the key event
before it can reach the LispWorks Editor.

We'd be happy to put this on our contributions page to make it easily
accessible.
