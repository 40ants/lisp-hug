                <h1>NLP Engineer position at Wyckoff NLP Inc.</h1>
                <pre>Hello Lisp-hug, and greetings!

Wyckoff NLP has been working with Harlequin/Xanalys LispWorks for years, 
and now needs to do some hiring. The Ad speaks for itself.

Regards,

President

---------------------------
AI and NLP Engineers
Wyckoff NLP, Inc.

We have several openings for senior software engineers experienced in 
Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, and/or Knowledge 
Representation.

Advanced degree, foreign language ability, and security clearance is 
preferred. U.S. citizenship is required.

All work is to be performed in the Maryland/DC/Virginia area.

We have urgent immediate need for one highly-cleared NLP-experienced 
Lisp/Java developer able to learn and understand the roles of numerous 
modules within a complex NLP system and able to read ANSI CommonLisp 
readily in support of an effort to overhaul the suite and framework. 
This not 'just a Lisp-to-Java port' though the initial task will involve 
replacement of a CommonLisp control structure with a more flexible and 
interoperable Java framework. The system involves a number of 
independent in-house, COTS, and GOTS modules written in Java, 
CommonLisp, and C, and continues to evolve. The project is healthy, 
growing, and highly visible at the customer site. A tremendous opportunity!

Additional positions require at least 6 years experience in software 
analysis and design, or 2 years experience and a recent specifically 
relevent advanced degree. Specific desired areas of experience include: 
knowledge-based domain-specific event and data extraction, EELD, 
multilingual and Arabic text processing, multilingual name matching, 
object identification, data mining, machine learning, system 
architecture, OODB schema and system design, and software integration. 
Strong skills in Java or Lisp programming are required.

Salary and benefits are compelling. All employees are offered six weeks 
vacation in addition to ten holidays.

Wyckoff NLP, Inc. is a small growing software consulting company located 
in Woodstock, Maryland. We hire only top notch personnel and pride 
ourselves on the creative and high-quality workmanship we provide to our 
clients.

Very funny Java more flexible than Common Lisp, I can not stand this
kind of "jobs" anymore. It's nearly alway complete wasted time and
money to port things... interoperability very funny again. Where's the
interoperability if you must have all in Java?

I wish they would not find anyone or find someone and will go out of
business within the next 5 years.
