Before I try what's out there, I figured I'd ask: is anyone using a 
LLGPL'ed (or BSD) ssl/https _client_ with lispworks pro under windows?
Any recommendations?

                 <h1>Re: SSL+https client?</h1>
                 <pre>Hi Bulent,

&gt is anyone using a LLGPL'ed (or BSD) ssl/https _client_ with lispworks
&gt pro under windows?

I've used the SSL library written by Jochen Schmidt and Wade Humeniuk
(I forgot the link, but I suppose Google will find it for you). I use
it as part of a simple-minded HTTPS server on Lispworks Pro + Windows NT.

It took me some time to get this running, mostly because I knew nothing
about SSL and I had some trouble linking it with the right dll's (for
both zlib and ssl). I also had to add a Gray streams UNREAD-CHAR method
to get things working correctly with the rest of my system.

If you're interested in my version or want to know more details, let me know.

Regards,

Arthur

P.S. Istanbul is still Europe, right? Maybe you want to subscribe to the

Whoops, I must have missed this one on tuesday and only saw Arthur's
reply today. I've been using the SSL wrapper code from Jochen Schmidt
that Arthur mentioned in two different projects which both resulted in
delivered Win32 executables. Both of the executables included simple,
home-grown http clients which could also make https connections. I can
dig out the relevant code and send it to you privately if you're
interested.

I guess it should also be possible to use the more sophisticated http
client contained in (Portable) AllegroServe together with SSL.

HTH,
Edi.
