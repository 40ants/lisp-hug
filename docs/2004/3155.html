                <h1>Console image that can do CAPI</h1>
                <pre>Hi all,
I'm trying to create an image that will give me a console which can 
display CAPI interfaces as well. I'd like to be able to, say, open emacs,
run this image, put in, for instance, 

(capi:contain (make-instance 'capi:text-input-pane))

I can do this as it stands now and get a window displayed, but all keyboard 
input goes to the Terminal rather than to the CAPI interface. I know
that for delivering it's important to use the application bundle and all
that, but I'd like to get just a simple image that has this functionality.

Is this possible?

                 <pre>Apologies Dave for the duplicates, meant for this to get to the list the first 
time as well.

Still no luck...

Here's what I've got at the moment
a save-image script named "save-image.lisp"
that looks like

(load-all-patches)
(save-image "foo" :environment nil)
(quit)

From my home directory, I run

/Applications/LispWorks/LispWorks.app/Contents/MacOS/lispworks-4-3-0-darwin
-init save-image.lisp -siteinit -

and the image is saved just fine
So, to use the full pathname, I run

/Users/tayloj/foo

and my transcript looks like

CL-USER 1 &gt (mp:initialize-multiprocessing)

CL-USER 2 &gt (capi:contain (make-instance 'capi:text-input-pane))
#&lt;Capi:Text-Input-Pane  100B457B&gt

CL-USER 3 &gt The text input pane in the container window has focus and
I'm typing into it

The problem is that that text on the third line is showing up in the Terminal
and not in the container window. The same thing happens if I start with
-multiprocessing and omit the call to mp:initialize-multiprocessing

The same thing also happens if I execute this from an xterm under X11.

Now, here's something somewhat interesting:
I make a file "some-file.lisp" in which is
(load-all-patches)
(mp:initialize-multiprocessing)

and run:
echo "(capi:contain (make-instance 'capi:text-input-pane))" |
/Applications/LispWorks/LispWorks.app/Contents/MacOS/lispworks-4-3-0-darwin
-init some-file.lisp -siteinit -

and I get a text input pane I can type into. Of crouse, the listener
dies from EOF,
but that's a different issue.

when I run _my_ saved image, thus:
echo "(capi:contain (make-instance 'capi:text-input-pane))" |
/Users/tayloj/foo -init some-file.lisp -siteinit -

I can't type into the input pane

If I save a new image which doesn't have patches loaded (in the same
way but without loading
patches in the save-image script), to do:

echo "(capi:contain (make-instance 'capi:text-input-pane))" |
/Users/tayloj/foo-no-patches -init some-file.lisp -siteinit -

I still cannot type into the input pane.

Any ideas? All help is much appreciated.

&gt I seem to recall this issue from when we began working on the
&gt LispWorks port. Try running your executable with its full path.
&gt
&gt Note that you will also need to switch on multiprocessing before
&gt displaying CAPI windows. You can do this by
&gt
&gt  (MP:INITIALIZE-MULTIPROCESSING)
&gt
&gt before calling CAPI:CONTAIN.
