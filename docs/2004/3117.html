                <h1>CAPI:EDITOR-PANE and modify-editor-pane-buffer</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

I'm using a CAPI:EDITOR-PANE.

I'm using (modify-editor-pane-buffer ed :contents text) in a call back 
to set the content of the pane.

There seems to be some restriction on what text is allowed to be.

simple-base-string appears to work

An array of characters appears to be a disaster on LWM. Everything from 
an immediate editor error (which is fine) to more serious problems.

What are the rules? What is the best way to conform to the rules?

Currently I'm using (format nil "~A" array-of-characters) to convert 
but is there a better way.

BTW, this appears to be a contributing factor to my problems with LWM 
flakiness (a reboot was needed in combination with the conversion to 
simple-base-string).

Cheers,
Bob

I have not used this function, but my first suggestion is to use the 
editor Set External Format command before you try to use characters. I 
think the default encoding is latin-1. As long as the external format 
is set correctly, I am able to use unicode without any problems.

Best,
