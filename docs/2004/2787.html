                <h1>Microsoft Word Document Import</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

I have an archive of relatively simple MS Word documents and would like 
to read them into Lisp, process them and save into a database. Has 
somebody implemented an import of a MS Word document? I'm really 
thankful for any answer.

Kind Regards,
Lukas

I doubt that anybody has (in Lisp). This is a rather heavy task and
AFAIK the Word format itself is proprietary and not documented by
Microsoft.

One option might be to use an external program/library like wvWare[1].

Another option would be to convert the Word documents to RTF and write
a Lisp parser for that. That should be straightforward albeit
tedious. I almost did that some months ago but the project fortunately
went into another direction. Apart from the official RTF documents
this cheap little book is very helpful:

HTH,
Edi.

It should be relatively easy to connect to Word through its COM
interface by means of the LispWork's COM/Automation API.
