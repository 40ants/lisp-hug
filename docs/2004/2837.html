&gt &gt &gtHi
&gt &gt &gt
&gt &gt &gtOne my frind, who likes C++ much, asked me How to pass by reference
value
&gt &gt of primitive type to function. It's common technique in C/C++ to share
one
&gt &gt memory cell between multiple functions passing address of cell as value.
&gt One
&gt &gt way similar to it is to pass value wraped into cons cell. Another way is
&gt to
&gt &gt use dynamic extent or macro, but it is very ugly.
&gt &gt &gt
&gt &gt &gtAs far as I know a primitive value being passed to a function, remains
&gt &gt unmuttable object. So I have to use some wrapper...
&gt &gt &gtTo answer a question I should find some way to do it like below:
&gt &gt &gt
&gt &gt &gt(let ((mutable-var 2))
&gt &gt &gt    (function-to-change-var mutable-var)
&gt &gt &gtmutable-var)
&gt &gt &gt
&gt &gt &gtSo mutable-var is not equals 2 after calling of function-to-change-var.
&gt &gt
&gt &gt Why would you want to do this in Lisp?  WHat are you really trying to
do?
&gt &gt I ask because though C and C++ programers frequently need to pass "by
&gt &gt reference" parameters, I as a Lisp programmer don't recall ever having
to
&gt do
&gt &gt so.
&gt
&gt He want pass reference to some "place" to many functions which can modify
&gt their arguments,
&gt so they can modify that place. He said it is way of sharing mutable value
&gt between multiple functions
&gt which were defined somewhere. I can do it with non primitive types easily,
&gt but for example numbers are immutable.
&gt Maybe best way is to wrap number to cons cell.
&gt
&gt He would thought that is impossible in Lisp. For some reasons I must prove
&gt him that thing is possible somehow and
&gt show most elegant way.
&gt
&gt
&gt &gt The typical use for by-reference parameters in C and C++ is for a
function
&gt &gt to return more than one value, e.g. returning a sucess/failure code as
the
&gt &gt value of the function and filling in some structure which was passed by
&gt &gt reference.  The way one would do this in Lisp is to have the function
&gt return
&gt &gt multiple values.  In Lisp, functions can return more than one value.  In
&gt &gt C and C++ they can't.
&gt
&gt I know. But looks like ability to return multiple values is not only one
&gt reason.
&gt
&gt For example at first we have closure:
&gt
&gt (let ((var 5))
&gt
&gt     (defun change-var-one ()
&gt         (setf var 6))
&gt
&gt     (defun change-var-two ()
&gt         (setf var (+ var 7)))
&gt
&gt     (defun change-var-three ()
&gt         (incf var)))
&gt
&gt Now we want to declare change-var-one, change-var-two, change-var-three in
&gt one place, declare var
&gt in another place and call these functions passing reference to place:
&gt
&gt (let ((place-one 5)
&gt        (place-two 5))
&gt
&gt     (change-var-one place-one)
&gt     (change-var-one place-two)
&gt     (change-var-two place-one)
&gt     (change-var-two place-two))
&gt
&gt More than that, he want to pass reference from outer world.
&gt
&gt (defun one-big-fun (reference-place)
&gt     (change-var-one reference-place)
&gt     (change-var-two reference-place)
&gt )
&gt
&gt &gt If you really need to be able to have some function modify a value that
it
&gt &gt doesn;t have access to, you can always pass a closure which modifies the
&gt &gt value, e.g.:
&gt &gt
&gt &gt for some code fragment
&gt &gt
&gt &gt    ...
&gt &gt    (let ((change-this-value 7))
&gt &gt      (some-function #'(lambda (new-value)
&gt &gt                         (setq change-this-value new-value)))
&gt &gt      ;; At this point the value of CHANGE-THIS-VALUE is 4
&gt &gt      )
&gt &gt    ...
&gt &gt
&gt &gt which calls SOME-FUNCTION and expects it to modify the value of
&gt &gt CHANGE-THIN-VALUE
&gt &gt
&gt &gt (defun some-function (value-changer)
&gt &gt   (funcall value-changer 4))
&gt
&gt Anyway, thank you, for your kind advice.
&gt
&gt Though it is another way to create a wrapper. Would it be efficient to
call
&gt function every time to change value ?
&gt
&gt Maybe there are some ways to do same thing with totaly different approach
&gt ?????
&gt
&gt So I repeat conditions and question:
&gt     1) There is some place where primitive value is stored
&gt     2) There are some functions which should modify places we point on, so
&gt we can share places between functions.
&gt
&gt How to share places between some functions and have ability to point place
&gt by name for that functions in most
&gt elegant way (is it closures, or macro, or dynamic vars ...) ?
&gt
&gt Best regards
&gt Lisper
