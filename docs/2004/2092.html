                <h1>color problem with capi in LWL 4.3.6</h1>
                <pre>hello!

In LW 4.2.7 for linux, and in the Windows and mac versions of 4.3.6, 
the following code will give red background to "Write here", whereas 
in 4.3.6 for linux, the back-ground will have the default color.

Is this a bug in 4.3?

(I use OpenMotif 2.2)

(in-package :user)

(capi:define-interface gazonk ()
  ()
  (:panes
   (input capi:text-input-pane :title "Write here"))
  (:layouts
   (main capi:column-layout '(input) :background :red)))

(capi:display (make-instance 'gazonk))

                 <h1>MySQL Under Mac OS X</h1>
                 <pre>Does any one have experience using MySQL (4.0.18) under Mac OS X with
LispWorks 4.3.6 and Common SQL?

Any clues about finding and configuring IODBC drivers?

Any clues about configuring for LW Common SQL?

Previously, I got MySQL (3.23) working under Redhat Linux 8 with 
key help from Xanalys, and found it to be very painful to get the
driver configured and working with common SQL. But after a bug
fix from Xanalys, the database application worked flawlessly.

Given the importance of databases in many applications, it
would be very useful to avoid duplicated configuration pain by
maintaining an FAQ with precise instructions for:

	* Selecting database &amp; driver versions that work with LW.

	* Finding, compiling, and configuring drivers

	* Configuring Common SQL (or other db interfaces)

Once you get lisp talking to the database, then productivity is
high. It is ironic that configuration of the link to Lisp is so 1960s.

Franz is providing a non-blocking direct interface to
MySQL (http://www.franz.com/support/tech_corner/mysql020403.lhtml)

Such an direct interface would doubtless be a big plus for LW, especially if
it enables faster, non-blocking performance and supports non-consing
operations (e.g., mapping functions over returns rather than consing
lists).

                 <h1>Re: MySQL Under Mac OS X</h1>
                 <pre>Below is a recipe for getting the current version of MySQL running under
MacOS X 10.3.3. As yet, I can't get Common SQL to connect to MySQL.

UNIX-level installations

	MySQL4.0.18 was installed from: 

		http://www.mysql.com/downloads/index.html

	MyODBC 3.51.06 was installed by running the driver installer from: 

		http://www.serverlogistics.com/mysql.php

	ODBC Administrator was used to configure the drivers and DSN following 
	instructions in steps 4-9 in: 

		http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/bergert/osx/tip09.htm

	Testing with the mysql client reveals that the database works.

	Testing with odbctest revealed that ODBC was working.

LispWorks Initializations

     (progn
	(require "odbc")
	(setf sql:*default-database-type* :odbc)

	(sys:run-shell-command "setenv OBDCINI \"/Library/myobdc/etc/odbc.ini\"")
	(sys:run-shell-command "setenv OBDCSYSINI \"/Library/myobdc/etc/\"")
	(sys:run-shell-command "setenv MYSQL_HOME \"/usr/local/mysql\"")

	(setq sql:*sql-libraries* "/usr/local/mysql/")

	(sql:initialize-database-type :database-type :odbc)

	(setq sql:*sql-loading-verbose* t))

Unfortunately, the following form produces a lisp-side error.

 (sql:connect "mysql/root/pw" :database-type :odbc)

                 <pre>Below is a recipe for getting the current version of MySQL running under
MacOS X 10.3.3. Thanks to a private patch from Xanalys, I can now
get Common SQL to connect to MySQL.

I am still interested in other people's experiences and clues.

I am wondering if it would make more sense to compile the MyOBDC 
driver from mysql.com, but I don't know how to set the configuration
switches etc for MacOSX. Compilation does not look straight forward
as some additional libraries are required.

The following form connects to the database, using a private
patch from Xanalys.

 (sql:connect "mysql/root/pw" :database-type :odbc)

There may be some additional bugs lurking.
