                <h1>RE: Oracle BLOBs with Common SQL</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

first of all, thanks for your quick responses.  I summarize
comment on them below.

&gt &gt I can also insert some strings into the column:
&gt &gt
&gt &gt     (with-connection *db-conn-spec*
&gt &gt       (insert-records :into [test]
&gt &gt                       :attributes '(id data)
&gt &gt                       :values '(1 "simple string")))
&gt &gt
&gt &gt but if the string contains null character (of code 0) then it
&gt &gt is truncated :-(
&gt

&gt
&gt I'm not familiar with Oracle, but in PostgreSQL you need to escape 
&gt non-printables (including nulls) as octal values:
&gt
&gt "mystring\\000"
&gt
&gt Since inserting strings works as long as you don't have nulls, you 
&gt might want to check the Oracle documentation to see if there is a 
&gt similar convention.

Unfortunately, Oracle is not as clever as PostgreSQL and generally
it doesn't allow escaping (except for single quotes and the SELECT
clause).

&gt &gt I get the following error coming from sql::execute-with-sqlbindparameter: 
&gt &gt 
&gt &gt     CL-USER 46 &gt (with-connection *db-conn-spec* 
&gt &gt                   (insert-records :into [test] 
&gt &gt                                   :attributes '(id data) 
&gt &gt                                   :values '(1 v))) 
&gt &gt 
&gt &gt     Error: Failed to allocate foreign object of size 2147483648 [allocator NIL] 
&gt &gt       1 (abort) Return to level 0. 
&gt &gt       2 Return to top loop level 0. 
&gt 
&gt [Dave Fox]
&gt 
&gt You appear to have passed the symbol v rather than its value.

You are right.  But even if it is fixed [ :values (list 1 v) ]
I get the same error message.  It seems that the only data type
allowed for values corresponding to BLOBs is string.

&gt But anyway, CLOB/BLOB types are not supported in Common SQL. The SQL
&gt types that we support directly for Oracle are CHAR, VARCHAR2, NUMBER,
&gt LONG, ROWID and DATE.

Yes, I know that, but for our applications we need BLOBs and,
to tell the truth, I prefer to invest some time to try to find
a way of using BLOBs with Common SQL rather than spend it on
boring J2EE-based development.

&gt In general it is helpful if, when you think you have found a bug, you
&gt supply a bug report including the stack backtrace. Instructions are at
&gt http://www.lispworks.com/support/bug-report.html. 

Actually, I don't think that the behavior with arrays described above
is a bug.  I simply used an unsupported data type (and its conversion)
and I failed.  But I hope that it might be possible to "unofficially"
fix sql::execute-with-sqlbindparameter, so that it accepts data types
other than string and sends it through ODBC to Oracle, which will
take responsability for possible errors.
 
&gt &gt And that's all I can get.  Do you have any further ideas / experiences with 
&gt &gt registration of BLOB? 
&gt 
&gt Other users (not on this list) did try using the Oracle LONG type to
&gt access CLOB data. I don't actually know whether they were successful.

CLOBs work without problems in my case (after upgrade to the newest
Oracle 9i ODBC driver).

Anyway, I will try further and inform you if I succeed.

Best regards,

Jaroslaw Tomczak
