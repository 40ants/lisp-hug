                <h1>RE: Multiple clauses in KW:FINDALL</h1>
                <pre>Sigh. I found the trouble. It seems I must package-qualify the TEST
operator, like this:

(kw:findall '?x '(and (hobbit ?x age ?a) (kw:test (&lt; ?a 50))))

The only reason I stumbled upon this solution is because I happened to run a
test within the KW-USER package and it worked.

Ah well...

&gtHi. I would like to query our kb using something similar to the following.

I think the (( ... )) syntax just means: run the Lisp code. The result 
is not used to control the Prolog backtracking. If you want the result 
to control the backtracking then I think you have to use (test ( ... )). ie
 

	(kw:findall '?x '(and (frodo ?x age ?age) (test (&lt; ?age 50))))

I recommend that application packages use kw.

BTW for completeness the ((...)) syntax can probably also be made to 
work if you bind to something:

(kw:findall '?x '(and (hobbit ?x age ?a) ((&lt; ?a 50) t)))

Assuming &lt; returns t. 

You might also find there is a Prolog predicate version:

(kw:findall '?x '(and (hobbit ?x age ?a) (&lt; ?a 50)))

Although you may have to watch your packages again.
