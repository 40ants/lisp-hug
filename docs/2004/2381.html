                <h1>RE: Listing KW structs?</h1>
                <pre>Sure. There's a KW tool in that allows one to view all classes known to KW.
But, I don't see a way to view KW structs in a similar manner. We have many
of those in addition to KW classes in our system; it would be useful
(sometimes) to be able to see them as well, through the Lispworks ide.

Cheers, David.

Can you explain what you mean? Where would you like to see them?
