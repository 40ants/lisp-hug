                <h1>cl-ppcre in LispWorks?</h1>
                <pre>I'm trying to set up cl-ppcre so that I can "require" it in LispWorks. 
This is the first time I've tried to do anything like this, so I may be 
missing something obvious.

I've been working through a series of problems:

1) "require" needs a pathname for the library

2) LW doesn't have a "mk" package for "mk:defsystem", so I deleted it 
in the cl-ppcre.system file

3) Loading cl-ppcre.system produces an error: "lisp" was found where a 
keyword symbol is expected. I don't see the cause of this.

At this point, I decided to ask if anyone has massaged the cl-ppcre 
package to work with LW 4.3.7, and can share it, or tell me what I need 
to do to make this work.

TIA,

  - Stoney

                 <h1>Re: cl-ppcre in LispWorks?</h1>
                 <pre>Funny how 90% of the time I figure something out right after sending a 
message.

I didn't realize that the "make" defsystem isn't compatible with the 
defsystem in LW.

So, I've got cl-ppcre compiled and loaded. Works great!

How do I set this up so that I can just (require "cl-ppcre" 
"lib:cl-ppcre"), or something like that?

TIA for any help.

REQUIRE is not so well defined.

You can get MK:DEFSYSTEM for the CLOCC (http://clocc.sf.net)  It is a 
portable defsystem utility that works on LW.

Looks like you just need the MK:DEFSYSTEM file.  in alternative you 
have to write a LW system specification

Some Lisp implementations provide "hooks" for REQUIRE so you can set
up your libraries to be loaded with REQUIRE. SBCL does, for example,
LispWorks doesn't.

However, it is possible to change the behaviour of LW's REQUIRE to do
what you want. Look at the source code of Debian's
common-lisp-controller[1] to see how this can be done.

HTH,
Edi.

Yes, it only works on Debian - and maybe on Gentoo (with emerge
instead of apt-get).

&gt I can't find a link to the CLC source anywhere either.

&gt I found asdf-install, though, so it might help. I didn't realize

Well, it's a long way to go until we have something like CPAN, but
it's a start... :)
