                <h1>Three more MOP problems</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

I have encountered three more MOP problems.

You already state in the documentation that you implement 
make-method-lambda differently - it accepts a different argument than 
specified in AMOP. However, you also don't seem to use it correctly in 
defmethod. The AMOP specifies that the second value returned by 
make-method-lambda is a property list that specifies keyword/value 
pairs to passed to the corresponding make-instance call. This is 
roughly what should happen:

(let ((method (multiple-value-bind
                     (method-lambda method-initargs)
                     (make-method-lambda
                      generic-function
                      (class-prototype (generic-function-method-class 
generic-function))
                      lambda-list declarations body environment)
		    (apply #'make-instance
			   (generic-function-method-class generic-function)
			   :function (enclose method-lambda environment)
			   (append initargs method-initargs)))))
;;                    this ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ is missing!
     (add-method generic-function method))

This would allow passing information from one's own make-method-lambda 
specializations to initialize-instance methods for one's own method 
classes. (The workaround is to bind this information to special 
variables, but this isn't nice because it works essentially only by 
providing one's own defmethod macro.)

It would be great if you could make this work.

The next thing is that you state that you don't implement 
compute-applicable-methods-using-classes. However, the interesting 
thing about compute-applicable-methods-using-classes is not to be able 
to call it, but to provide new methods for it for one's own generic 
function classes. The AMOP states in some detail how c-a-m-u-c and 
compute-applicable-methods depend on each other and under what 
circumstances the result of c-a-m-u-c is cached. I think it is 
important to know whether and when this kind of caching takes place for 
c-a-m internally in your MOP in order to be able to specialize c-a-m 
correctly. (I haven't run into any real problems here because it turned 
out that implementing methods for those functions was the wrong thing 
to do in my case, but I have noticed this problem anyway.)

One more thing: You don't implement reader-method-class and 
writer-method-class or, to be more specific, defclass doesn't call them 
internally. I need to be able to redefine the method classes for slot 
accessors and I don't know how to do this without those two generic 
functions. Again, at least you should document the lack of those.


All the best,
Pascal
