                <h1>memory profiling</h1>
                <pre>hello,

I have a LW-based server application that I might need to put on a
diet: I need to track down which parts of the application that
generate unneccessary garbage, and/or what kind of data that is.

The Profiler in LW doesn't seem to be capable of memory usage
profiling, and checking individual parts with TIME seems a little
tedious.

It could possibly be quite helpful if I could tell the GC to give me
statistics on the types of objects collected (as fine-grained as
possible, but at least it would be great to distinguish conses,
strings and clos-objects, which are the kind of stuff I waste a _lot_
of). Is there a way to do this?
