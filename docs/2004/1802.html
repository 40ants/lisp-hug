                 <pre>
   after further delving into the capi manual and its examples I found
   (LW Personal - Mac OS X 10.3.2 iMac):

   9.2.4 Prompting for files

   (capi:prompt-for-file "Enter a file:")

   (capi:prompt-for-file
      "Enter a filename:"
      :pathname "/Users/jdabel/Documents/LispWorks Personal/")

	   both are not reacting when "Show files: lisp Source files..." I try 
   to select a lisp file, only when using "Show files: All Files (*.*) I 
   can select one.

What I see (Mac OS X 10.2.8) is that a filter does not work initially
if it specifies multiple patterns (that is, contains a semi-colon).

However, selecting another filter in the dialog's "Show files:" panel,
and then selecting "Lisp Source Files (*.lisp;*.lsp)" shows the lisp
files correctly. so it's just the initial state that is broken. This
is a bug in LispWorks for Macintosh which we will fix for a future
release. Thank you for reporting it.
															                               

   and:
   5.5.2 Tab - layouts
	   Only two of the three tabs are refreshed when clicking - one is missing

Not quite sure what you mean here. Following the examples in the CAPI
User Guide 5.5.2, I see firstly a tab-layout with three coloured
panes, which works. The second example example displays a tab-layout
with 5 graphs, and this works correctly too. If the problem is
repeatable for you, please could you describe it with some more
detail?


   Wish catalog:
   Â• Enlarge the min-size of the interface window (one can overlook it, it 
   is too small). The size should be so large to show all three left 
   controls of the window).

I see what you mean although in real life one never instantiates
CAPI:INTERFACE - you work with your own subclasses which will appear
larger because they actually contain some windows. These classes could
also specify their own geometry hints.

                 <h1>"common" CommonSQL question</h1>
                 <pre>How do I have to arrange structures similiar to this:
(sql:def-view-class person (qss.db:unique-id-mixin)
  ((name :accessor name :type (string #.+name-max+) :initarg :name)
   (e-mail :accessor e-mail :column e_mail :type (string #.+e-mail-max+) :initarg :e-mail)))


(sql:def-view-class contacts (person)
  ((entry-date  :accessor entry-date :type integer :column entry_date :initarg :entry-date)
   (info :accessor info :type integer :initarg :info :initform 0)
   (id :type integer
       :column id
       :accessor id)
   (person :db-kind :join
             :db-info (:join-class person
                       :retrieval :deferred
                       :set nil
                       :home-key id
                       :foreign-key id)
            :accessor person)))


The idea is of course a sort of Objekt hierachy. What I want in the
end is that the person part is stored into the table Person, and the
extensions elswhere. 

Of course I would like to access either a persons name or a contacts
name with (name obj), and the base idea is to be able to work with
objects, which happens to have the nice extra feature of making
themselves persistant.

Friedrich
