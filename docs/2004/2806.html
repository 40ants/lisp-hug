The second COLLECT has already ended the WHEN, and an END has
to match an IF, WHEN or UNLESS.

Try this:

(loop for x below 10 when (&lt; x 3) collect x end collect x)
=&gt (0 0 1 1 2 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)

I guess the error message is a little confusing though.

(And thanks for introducing me to END.)

On second thoughts...

The spec says "If this keyword [END] is not supplied, the next
loop keyword marks the end." So I guess the /first/ COLLECT marks
the end of the WHEN (but it is included within the scope of the
WHEN).

Do you know about AND?

(loop for x below 10 when (&lt; x 3) collect x and collect x)
=&gt (0 0 1 1 2 2)

In my experience, whenever using any combination of loop clauses that I've 
not used at least 20 times before, it's best to macroexpand the LOOP 
expression to see what it produces.

If that is the case one wonders what END is good for anyway...

Hmmm, yes. I think it ties in with using AND.

Here's an example where END makes a difference:


(loop for x from 1 below 10
      when (&lt; x 7)
      when (evenp x) collect x
      end
      and collect (* x 100))
=&gt (100 2 200 300 4 400 500 6 600)


(loop for x from 1 below 10
      when (&lt; x 7)
      when (evenp x) collect x
      and collect (* x 100))
=&gt (2 200 4 400 6 600)


So I think:
- WHEN has a subsidiary clause (introduced by the
  first COLLECT in Nick's original example).
- When the spec says "If this keyword [END] is not
  supplied, the next loop keyword marks the end",
  this means the next loop keyword after the
  subsidiary clause.

Maybe you're right. Then again, maybe you're not.

LOOP is nice, but the corner cases are a mess. IMHO the best
solution is to just use Jonathan Amsterdam's ITERATE when things
get complicated.

Marc Battyani's CL-PDF (or was it CL-TYPESETTING?) also recently
got bitten by different interpretations of some LOOP subtleties.
He decided to switch to ITERATE. Problem solved.

Yes. I wouldn't use those ANDs and ENDs in real code.

I use AND. I rarely, if ever, use END.

(I tried grepping for END in my code, but that was useless.
I use it far too often as a variable name.)
