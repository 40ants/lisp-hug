Hi,

There is process-wait-with-timeout and process-wait-with-local-timeout. However, it depends on what you want to happen in ‘form, because that may require different solutions.

Can you be more specific?

Hi Pascal

thanks.  I had a cursory look at process-wait-with-timeout and process-wait-with-local-timeout, however, they seem to me the building blocks for what I have in mind.

Essentially FORM should be a “simple” (YMMV) one, although it may run for a long time; especially not a form that mucked the scheduler and or other multiprocessing thingies.

Let me explain the very, very basic use-case I have :)

I teach Common Lisp to (a lot of) students.  I need to grade (a lot of) projects and I use a simple unit tester to test results (Franz’s).  Unfortunately, the id… ahem, the young minds striving to learn often write “loopy” programs.  I need a timeout to interrupt the computation and do some cleanup.

Cheers

Hi,

OK, then I think the best is to use process-run-function to run the students’ code, and process-join to wait for their code to finish. process-join takes a timeout parameter, so when process-join returns nil, the code executes for too long. You can then use process-terminate or process-kill to terminate that process.
