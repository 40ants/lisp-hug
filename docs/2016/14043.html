I have to tip my hat to the LW crew! I just finished a marathon session of coding for SMP multi-threading. The prevalence of locks is astonishing in numbers of them required. And I have seen hints that Martin and crew must have spent a lot of time honing locks to make them as efficient as possible. It looks like a lot of effort was expended to try spinning them at first, resorting to a full OS lock as a last resort.

I’d love to see some comments or a writeup on the details. I already found Martin’s ECLM/2009 presentation slides. I think I remember being in the audience for that one too, in Hamburg?

I continue to be quite impressed with LW.
