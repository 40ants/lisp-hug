IMHO, low resolution buttons guarantee that the HyperSpec is displayed
correctly on potentially every computer or device on any OS version.

I would only recommend to change the main font from "serif" to "sans-serif"
as the latter facilitates reading from screen.

There are lots of stupid "modern" sites that an experienced user would not
visit even twice :-(

Excuse me, but I fail to see the point.  It's modern today, but next
year Apple will issue a new fashion statement, and it'll look as
outmoded as iOS 6 look.

Why not wait for all the fashinistas to die and stop this silly seasonal
game, and then update everything to the ultimate fashion?

In the meantime, better spend your time implementing an AI to help
newbies in irc://irc.freenode.org/#clnoobs

Recently on the lisp subreddit the CL Ultraspec project was mentioned.
I've seen it before, its very incomplete, but I think it or something
like it is likely to succeed in the end - especially if it is extended
with documentation for common libs like alexandria.

That strikes me as a good thing, at least for people who use competent browsers (which I assume everyone does now).

Yeah.

The TODO page says "Everything" ...

Means a lot of stuff is not there - at least on almost _all_ the pages I looked.

As stated elsewhere, Only Chapter 14:Conses seems anywhere near written up.

With all due respect, then, I'm not sure that the Hyperspec will *ever*
be the document you want.  It's a spec.  You are probably better off
with Peter Seibel's Practical Common Lisp, or David Lamkins' Successful
Lisp, instead of trying to turn a spec into something it's not meant to
be...

Have you tried Common Lisp the Language, 2nd. Edition?

http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/html/cltl/cltl2.html

There are some differences between the language it describes and
standard Common Lisp but most of these shouldn't be relevant to a
novice.

You could also try Keene's Object-oriented Programming in Common Lisp,
if you are particularly interested in CLOS (which is not in CLtL2).

                 <h1>Re: Sprucing up the HyperSpec</h1><div dir="ltr"><div>Sorry I feel like I should elaborate on the reasoning behind calling the gigamonkey lisp thing god awful. I feel like it just vomits information at you and not to you. Granted 
there are those who like information presented to them from the ground 
up from how the bits are transferred until you are worked all the way up
 to writing high level lambda functions. Some people don&#39;t care and just
 want to know how to get stuff done sure ruby on rails type 1 command 
and vwalah fully functioning web server, whatever. The most important is
 probably the dry approach that builds upon a foundation but keeps the 
material engaging. Unfortunately I think I am an edge case, I don&#39;t 
really seem to grasp or learn anything mechanically, visually, or 
auditorialy(?). I have to actually visualize in motion something before I
 actually understand what&#39;s going on. Doing something is empty for me, 
some people once they do it they get it like rebuilding a carburetor, or
 just read something although I have great recall on things that I&#39;ve 
read that&#39;s just more of a memory thing and not so much an 
understanding. But a dancing bill singing his way into congress cartoon 
tends to make more sense to me. If someone animates the particle 
interactions of a chemical reaction or maybe animated differing 
molecules to show the difference between ionic and covalent bonds, i 
grasp the material, retain it, and understand it on a fundamental level.
 Maybe being a child of the 80&#39;s and an overwhelming abundance of 
cartoons formed my neural pathways in a particular way I don&#39;t know. If 
someone animated a higher order function from beginning to processing 
all the way down to the hardware level with device interaction and back 
up again, I could debug in my head without ever even looking at a 
computer screen. Unfortunately information isn&#39;t presented that way in 
this world.<br><br></div>Matt<br></div><div class="gmail_extra"><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Wed, Jun 1, 2016 at 9:58 AM, Matthew Holevinski <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:eylusion@gmail.com" target="_blank">eylusion@gmail.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex"><div dir="ltr"><div><div>There are quite a few other learning materials I have yet to look at.

                 <h1>Re: Sprucing up the HyperSpec</h1>
                 <pre>I think this is a reasonable position, When I was learning cl, I would find myself trying to figure out what a function did,
or maybe, which version of let/let* to use (without even knowing of the existence of labels).
I would also find that even after reading the spec, I wouldn’t fully understand how to use it, I would be able to copy in the examples that they have written, but as I don’t have any context, I have to fiddle with parameters until I start to get an understanding of how a function behaves.

I don’t know if clojure is taboo on this mailing list, but it may be worth having a look at how their documentation is presented, (It’s not a spec, but it allows people to add examples, possibly with a comment on when this could be useful, or what other options are available). (eg. https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/-%3E).

I think there is definitely a space for a more engaging, and easier (for beginners) to parse documentation.
As an aside, it may be worth looking into http://phoe.tymoon.eu/clus/doku.php, to see if it can be filled out, and become a fleshed out source.
