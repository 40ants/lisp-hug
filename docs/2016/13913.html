                <h1>Editing on Mac</h1>
                <pre>
When I click on text that I’m editing in LispWorks, the insertion point generally ends up one character to the left of where I expect it to be. Is this some kind of preference setting, normal behavior outside the world of Macs, a bug, or what? And of course, how can I change it?

Hi,

on the Mac one expects that when you click on the character it works like this: left half -&gt insert mark before the character, right half -&gt insert mark after the character.

In Mac emulation mode when one uses LispWorks, every click on a character positions the insert mark before the character.

I think there is no easy way for the user to change that, but I think LispWorks support should already have a fix for that. ;-)

Regards,

Rainer

The LW editor seems to have the same functional behaviour as other editors on the mac as best I can tell.  I checked the following:

LW: click on character, cursor appears over that char and insertion point is to the left.

TextEdit: click on character, blinky bar appears between it and previous character, and that's where the insertion point is (same place in other words, but cursor shows between characters rather than over them);

Emacs (from https://emacsformacosx.com/, not whatever the default is): exactly as LW (cursor blinks unless blink-cursor-mode is false).

Sublime Text: as TextEdit.

Clozure editor: as TextEdit.

So it looks as if the difference is that the LW editor and Emacs displays the cursor marking the character to the right of the insertion point, while subl and TextEdit (and I presume other more native OSX editors) display it as a bar between the characters, but the insertion point is the same.  That difference is unsurprising given that before GUIs it wasn't possible to display the cursor between characters at all in general.

I think Emacs can make the cursor be a bar between characters, but I don't remember how that works.  Not sure about LW.

                 <pre>Thank you for the reply, and pardon my slow response, but it doesn’t work the way you describe. In the LispWorks editor with the Mac OS X emulation preference, no matter where I click in the character, even at its rightmost edge, the insertion point appears to the left of the character. I have not observed this in any other Mac programs, including the ones I’ve written in LispWorks.
