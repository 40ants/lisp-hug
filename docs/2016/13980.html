Hello all,

I require a bit of help (again) as i was assigned a project as i was 
assigned a project that was developed by people who no longer work in the 
company. Those programmers liked to keep the history of their code in the 
same file as the working branch... hence their is a lot of unused stuff in 
there.

In order to tidy up their code, i'd like a handy way to reference all 
functions that are defined but never used in order to remove them.

Currently, i'm using the Function Call Brower of the IDE and manually 
looking up each function recursively... but this is tedious! I checked the 
User Guide but might have missed the info i was looking for... Any tip will 
be very welcome!

It also won’t find functions invoked with apply or funcall.

A very long time ago there was XREF for Common Lisp which I used for 
this purpose. This was before I found Lispworks and don't know how it 
compares to the FCB.  Might be worth a look.

&gt Indeed! And it won't either find functions invoked at top level (during
&gt compilation/loading)... which makes the tool not very practical for what i
&gt intend to do.
&gt
&gt Any pointer to a tool/method to solve my problem will be of great help!
&gt
&gt (ofc: if the previous programmer had kept things tidy and documented their
&gt code, i wouldn't be there...)
