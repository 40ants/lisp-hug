Hi Sean,

I bought my first version of Lispworks (from my own money) almost
20 years ago and I'm still a happy customer.  I personally pay for
the yearly maintenance renewals but you're not required to do that.
As far as I know you can just buy it, own it, and use it for the rest
of your life without paying anything for maintenance.

Arthur

Hi Sean,

I use LW at work, but the I and the rest of the team uses it via
SLIME. I have fixed our build so that it can be loaded into the LW IDE
and we do like some of the features, but it is different enough from
Emacs and CL focused enough when we also want to be editing
JavaScript, Python and Matlab code, that so far we have stuck to
Emacs.

But I also live in Emacs and at home I typically use open source CL
implementations I won't mention here, so there's that, and the license
cost of LW is something for my employer to think about. My thoughts on
LW pricing are not relevant because they are not mine to pay.

That said, I have come to see why people do pay for this implementation.

Cheers

I essentially pay for it myself (I actually pay through a company I own half of).  I do have an intention to use it in anger at some point (and have done in the past) but am not doing so currently.

You can just buy a license and then you can use that version for ever.  If you want to keep it current then you can either buy each new version or you can pay a contract which gets you upgrades (I do this).  I think that's a common and fair model of charging.

I suspect other Lisps are now within epsilon of LW in terms of quality of implementation.  They are *not* within epsilon in terms of quality of environment, and since I spend a lot of time writing and debugging code I care about environment a lot: the LW environment is cheap for what it is.

There are use cases which are either not so easy supported or may need more documentation for LispWorks. Version 7 is already improving things a lot.

My impression is that the LispWorks runtime is quite a bit more stable than most of the other alternatives, especially given its capabilities.
That was again my impression when looking at the ARM port. For my CL-HTTP purposes LispWorks was/is working very well on ARM.

There are still areas where LispWorks is difficult to beat. Our sequencing tool called elPrep [1] works pretty well with LispWorks, and deals very well with large amounts of in-memory data, tested with a few hundreds of GB of data in RAM. We barely got SBCL to handle such amount of data, and it requires reconfiguration of SBCL, whereas LispWorks accommodates such data quite well.

We havenâ€™t ported elPrep to other CL implementations, so other CLs may also do well, but so far, LispWorks has always worked out very well for me and projects I have been involved in.

Hi,

we have licenses for most platforms at work, so I don't pay for it from
my own pockets. I think the yearly maintenance fee is a good deal
considering the value you get for it, but as other here have pointed
out, you don't have to pay for it if you'd rather just keep the version
you bought and do "pretty much what you want" with it.
