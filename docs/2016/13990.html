                <h1>Synchronization with system:make-directory</h1>
                <pre>
Hi!

I was fighting to synchronize two instances of LW-based applications
under Windows so that they would do some kind of activity sequentially
rather than in parallel.

I tried to create temporary "lock files", but I found that open seem
to be non-atomic. This reason or another, I could not make it work.

But I found there is an undocumented system:make-directory. I used the
following "mutex" imitation: "lock" function tries to make a
directory. If it succeedes we agree that it acquired a "mutex". If it
fails we assume some other process is holding the lock.

To unlock, we just delete-directory.

The question to LW team is the following: is it safe to use this
technique under Windows? If yes, I think it would worth documenting.

Otherwise I would need either to create FLI bindings to CreateMutex
and its neighbours or find some other approaches to achieve a
synchronization.

Maybe my problem have some other solution, but I didn't find one.

Have you tried DDE?

Thanks Ladislav. But what I do is simply a build script and that
directory thing works so far.

&gt Hi,
&gt
&gt depending on what you are trying to achieve, it might be an overkill, but
&gt have you considered those two application talking to each other? Like
&gt zero-mq, or lparallel (actualy maybe lfarm - https://lparallel.org/
&gt https://github.com/lmj/lfarm/blob/master/README.md)
&gt
&gt alternativelly, you can try to listen on specific port (and it should allow
&gt only one instance of app to listen on port) and then use something like
&gt zeroMQ to distribute messages (and effectively you can end up with one
&gt really small instance that will orchestrate others).
&gt
&gt in past, i have had many chances to see locking as pain in the ass, that
&gt can be resolved by queuing, and the "locking" is replaced by trying to get
&gt message, and only one worker succeeds.
&gt
&gt
&gt good luck
&gt
