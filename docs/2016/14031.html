                <h1>Is there a way to detect whether LW can save an image?</h1>
                <pre>
I am asking as maintainer of ASDF.  ASDF has operations that will save
an image and that will make a stand-alone executable.

I would like ASDF to signal an understandable error message when run on
a copy of LW that is incapable of doing these operations)

I believe that some versions (e.g., hobbyist) cannot do these operations
for license reasons.

Is there some way (e.g., a value in *FEATURES*) to tell if this is not
possible?  Alternatively, is there a distinctive error that LW will
raise if its license does not permit performing one or both of these
operations?

thank you,

r

Dear Georges,

(please allow me to chime in here, like Robert I am interested in this type of
check for ASDF)

I think the issue is not so much with `save-image`. (From my understanding,
that’s only unavailable on the personal edition which can be detected through the

  :lispworks-personal-edition

feature, although I’d appreciate it if someone could confirm this). The issue is rather
with `deliver`: The symbol will be available e.g. on the Hobbyist edition but the run-time
license check will fail(*). On the HobbyistDV edition, it would not. So a check that can
distinguish between Personal/Hobbyist and HobbyistDV/Professional/Enterprise would
help here. But something more specifically tailored towards the deliver-functionality
(and thus more future-proof) would be preferable. This applies to `save-image`, too.


Elias

(*) It looks like an untyped error to me, by which I mean (error &lt;string&gt). But maybe I’m
overlooking something.

Hi,

This will not work:


CL-USER 1 &gt (fboundp 'save-image)
T

CL-USER 2 &gt (symbol-package 'save-image)
#&lt;The HARLEQUIN-COMMON-LISP package, 5/8 internal, 271/512 external&gt

CL-USER 3 &gt (lisp-implementation-type)
"LispWorks Personal Edition"

CL-USER 4 &gt (lisp-implementation-version)
"6.1.1"

The same for lw:deliver. It looks like these functions are available but
with a "stub" which informs you what you cannot use them in this
version.
I've not able to find anything suspicious in *features* as well
comparing Personal and HobbyistDV editions.
