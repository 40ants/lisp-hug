                <h1>Error handling in image-pinboard-object</h1>
                <pre>
Hi,

I’ve got a situation where a corrupt image file is being read with gp:read-external-image and fed to a image-pinboard-object. This leads to an error (in convert-external-image) when the pinboard is being displayed. Is there any way to guard against this?

One possibility would be to load the image with read-and-convert-external-image in the first place, to be able to handle any errors there. However that is inconvenient in this case, as the image file is being read from a process which has no access to a graphics-port.

Thanks
Erik

Waited to see if anyone had a better answer, but seeing as they didn't: (untested!) if it were me I would create a pixmap-graphics-port and pass that around.

I haven't had this problem (I use image-pinboard-objects in the same
way), but would it help subclassing image-pinboard-object and make a
safeguarding :around method to draw-pinboard-object?
