		ELS'17 - 10th European Lisp Symposium

		   VUB - Vrije Universiteit Brussel
			       Belgium

			   April 3-4, 2017

		In co-location with &lt;Programming&gt 2017

	       http://www.european-lisp-symposium.org/


The purpose of the European Lisp Symposium is to provide a forum for
the discussion and dissemination of all aspects of design,
implementation and application of any of the Lisp and Lisp-inspired
dialects, including Common Lisp, Scheme, Emacs Lisp, AutoLisp, ISLISP,
Dylan, Clojure, ACL2, ECMAScript, Racket, SKILL, Hop and so on. We
encourage everyone interested in Lisp to participate.

The 10th European Lisp Symposium invites high quality papers about
novel research results, insights and lessons learned from practical
applications and educational perspectives. We also encourage
submissions about known ideas as long as they are presented in a new
setting and/or in a highly elegant way.

Topics include but are not limited to:

- Context-, aspect-, domain-oriented and generative programming
- Macro-, reflective-, meta- and/or rule-based development approaches
- Language design and implementation
- Language integration, inter-operation and deployment
- Development methodologies, support and environments
- Educational approaches and perspectives
- Experience reports and case studies

We invite submissions in the following forms:

  Papers: Technical papers of up to 8 pages that describe original
    results or explain known ideas in new and elegant ways.

  Demonstrations: Abstracts of up to 2 pages for demonstrations of
    tools, libraries, and applications.

  Tutorials: Abstracts of up to 4 pages for in-depth presentations
    about topics of special interest for at least 90 minutes and up to
    180 minutes.

  The symposium will also provide slots for lightning talks, to be
  registered on-site every day.

All submissions should be formatted following the ACM SIGS guidelines
and include ACM classification categories and terms. For more
information on the submission guidelines and the ACM keywords, see:
http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates and
http://www.acm.org/about/class/1998. The conference proceedings will be
published in the ACM Digital Library.
