Linear algebra is not a problem in C with tons of high-quality and
highly optimized
commercial and open-source libraries available(BLAS/uBLAS, LAPACK,
Intell's MKL, Armadillo, Matrix Template Library, SuiteSparse to name a
few), with invested many man-years and top-of-the-edge research behind them,
so I guess better just to have good quality wrappers for them.

Alexey:

Making wrappers for them is a very non-trivial thing. Do you use Lisp
arrays? Foreign arrays?

If you use Lisp arrays, what do you do with GC? Pinning (non-portable,
non-reliable)? Stopping GC (possible concurrency issues)?

If you use foreign arrays, do you re-write all of Lisp's access
functions? How do you interface with Lisp array libraries? How do you
deal with GC? Finalizers (non-reliable)? What if you run out of
foreign memory space? How do you detect that and do a GC so the
finalizers can kick off?

Writing a proof-of-concept wrapper is very easy, but Getting It Right
(TM) is very difficult, in my opinion.

(FWIW: Matlisp, as conceived by Raymond Toy, used Lisp arrays with
stop-the-GC approach.)

Hi,

No I don't use CL for matrix libraries, I've written what there is no sense to
implement matrix library in CL because there are tons of them really
well optimized and well tested in C, and one just have to write good
wrappers for them(believe me it is still easier than implement the good
matrix library). I understand those who implements
these libraries in CL, but personaly I wouldn't do that.
