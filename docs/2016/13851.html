FWIW, Allegro CL has a partial solution to this problem.  You can tell
the lisp environment about definition-creating macros, and their Emacs
Lisp Interface can use that information to find definitions.  I've often
wanted to see this ported to SLIME (but don't know enough about SLIME
hacking to do it myself).

Which brings me back to an earlier point: if we are talking about IDEs,
we are leaving the realm of Lispworks-specific discussion.  This
discussion would be more productive in a CL-wide, or possibly a SLIME,
forum.

Certainly the LW IDE and SLIME do perform some parsing of s-expressions as they&#39;re entered. But if you wanted to provide slot hints, you&#39;d have to be able to expand any macro that reduced to defclass. And a macro can contain arbitrary code, so you need an entire LISP interpreter for that. The LW IDE should be ideally placed to do that since it is written in LW and runs LW in parallel (the same reason why IntelliJ is so good for Java, although it is getting better on other languages). But then you hit a security problem - a mischievous library could drop in a macro which performs &quot;rm -rf ~&quot; at expand time, and as soon as you started typing the name of that macro, the IDE would expand it for analysis and wipe out your home directory.<br><br></div>Mark<br><br></div><div class="gmail_extra"><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Fri, Apr 29, 2016 at 4:41 PM, Alessio Stalla <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:alessiostalla@gmail.com" target="_blank">alessiostalla@gmail.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex"><div dir="ltr">I think it&#39;s more because Lisp IDEs, ironically, are ultimately TEXT editors and not SEXP editors (including Paredit and similar).

Here is the point. When I use a commercial IDE, *I don't need to think*
about these things. The IDE takes care for these details for me, and I'm
doing what I wanted to do - to write a code. I don't need to think about
how it is implemented in the _commercial_ IDE I'm using. As for
macro DSLs, this is a part of compiler job to do and determine it for
me, not my. It is a part of compiler _services_ it could provide me as a
servant to make my life easier. Let it be not precise and not accurate -
but there should be at least an _attempt_ to help me.
And it is not a wet dream - IntelliJ IDEA does this stuff already for
Java, which is supposedly the more inferior language.

The problem is that so far "these things" are nothing, or not much.  Is
the loss of customizability worth having them?

And they're implemented only for some specific languages, not for lisp
or your own DSL.

Perhaps when we'll have Artifically Intelligent IDEs, that will debug
your code or just generate the correct code from the specification
document, perhaps then it'll be worthwhile losing customization and
choice of programming language.  But since in 2015 they are still
catching up with features you had in the "unix IDE", (and I'm not even
talking about the lisp environments), I still have strong doubts about
IDEs.

I mostly agree with Pascal’s reservations about IDE’s.<br>
<br>
AFAICT, the IDE was invented (enabled) in 1956 with the *language* Lisp 1.5..  The *language* contains the equivalents of LEX and YACC.  The *language* can act on itself.<br>
<br>
In my first Dr. Dobb’s article (1978/9?) I published source code for a SEXP editor and debugger in lisp.<br>
<br>
Other *languages* got IDE-envy and have been struggling to catch up.  Rather unsuccessfully, afaict.  If the *language* doesn’t have “LEX and YACC” built into it, you have to jump through hoops to get an IDE that is 50% as good as a lisp environment.<br>
<br>
Then, there’s the Unix (shell) environment, which makes things incredibly easy and simple.   Around the same time as the Unix shell was invented, there was another development, called FBP (flow-based-programming) which is even better at piping than the Unix shell is.  (Still actively discussed and developed - see google group flow-based-programming).<br>
<br>
The modern IDE is necessitated by inferior languages designed by syntax fascists.<br>
<br>
We should strive to getting rid of syntax and going back to simplicity.<br>
<br>
[Other examples of such wonderful simplicity are Rebol and the Smalltalk Blue Book].<br>
