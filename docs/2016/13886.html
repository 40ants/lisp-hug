                <pre>
I’ve been poking around the documentation to find out why my delivery script that worked fine on LW Pro Mac 6 isn’t working on 7. Does anyone know offhand what might have changed?

What I have succeeded in getting is a double-clickable app whose icon has a circle-slash symbol over it. When I run it my main window does not appear, and I get a menubar with a single menu that has my app name. The remaining menus, instead of being in the menubar, are available in a hierarchical menu item named "&lt;&lt;My Application’s Name&gt&gt application menus”.

Here’s a question for the active developers - I have some (Symbolics) Lisp code from mid-1980s. Since I still have two of the machines, I can run the code, but what should be my trajectory if I wanted to rewrite that code into something in a more current lisp? Say for a Mac Pro. Cost is not (necessarily) an object, since I would propose cost based on best solution. I haven’t actively developed (in Lisp or any other language) for 30 years, so it’s not a task I’d embark upon myself, but I’m curious to pose this proposition to others that have a love, respect and talent with the Lisp language. This thread caught my interest, since LW was something that seemed appropriate to consider, but for tinkering with code, is a bit prohibitive in cost.

Subject: Re: Changes to delivery on Mac

I think I've had the same problem when upgrading to LW7.
The solution I got from lw-support was to use :STARTUP-BITMAP-FILE NIL in the delivery keywords.
(in other work, do not use a startup bitmap anymore if you did use one)
It fixed the problem in my case.
There were also a few missing items in the default application menu (Quit, Hide etc.) which I have had to insert myself.

I am really envious! :)

I'd love to find a 3640 (plus display and mouse) in running condition ... have not seen anything for sale. My code from that era is , well, occupying disk space only ... been slowly migrating some of it to C++, but would love to run Lisp directly.

Am going to check out Clozure next ... based on feedback from people here.

It’s the one I usually use by default. It runs well on Windows, Linux, and OS X, and has a good FFI.

Thanks!

Please: do you know what graphics libraries may be available for it (perhaps from other sources) that I could use for stand-alone Windows applications? Not having used it yet, I'd to short-cut my learning curve with all of you all's experiences if I can!

I don’t know of a lot of libraries specifically written for ccl. You can look here to find portable graphics libraries available through quicklisp:

  http://quickdocs.org/search?q=graphics

It’s not necessarily the case that all of them will work with ccl.

One of the particularly nice things about ccl is that its foreign function interface is pretty good. If you’re wanting to do Windows-specific development, a reasonable way to do it if you’re happy making Windows calls directly is to use the FFI to do so. If you’re looking for a higher-level Lisp-flavored interface for rendering graphics, though, Allegro and Lispworks are most likely your best bet.
