                <h1>Compile and Debug quickload'ed CAPI app with LW7.0 for OSX</h1>
                <pre>
Hi,

I'm trying to write CAPI app and compile/load it locally via
quickload.
So I start the session, execute the (ql:quickload "myapp") and start
working.
When I do changes, I can recompile the buffers, restart the app
and see what my changes applied.

Here is the compilation output example:

;;; Safety = 3, Speed = 1, Space = 1, Float = 1, Interruptible = 1
;;; Compilation speed = 1, Debug = 2, Fixnum safety = 3
;;; Source level debugging is on
;;; Source file recording is  on
;;; Cross referencing is on
; (TOP-LEVEL-FORM 0)
;;;*** Warning in (PACKAGE "MEDIAIMPORT-UI"): Using DEFPACKAGE to modify #&lt;The
MEDIAIMPORT-UI package, 39/64 internal, 1/16 external&gt.
; (DEFPACKAGE "MEDIAIMPORT-UI")

However I cannot use a debugger. If I set the breakpoint using toolbar
it is ignored, if I set it manually via (break) function, the dialog
appears:

   Debug-Break in process "Cocoa Event Loop" {undebuggable process}

and no possibility to use source-level debug.
Nothing changes if I set (declaim (optimize (debug 3))) in the beginning
of the file or in REPL.

If I load any CAPI example using example-edit-file and compile it,
debugging works ok.

Is where a way to get debugging to work for my initially quickload'ed app?

I would guess that setting breakpoints is part of the toolchain and that quicklisp is not (yet) part of the LW toolchain.  (Debuggers need to modify the actual code).

Try this: after quickloading, do file&gt&gtcompile&amp;load the file you want to debug.  Then set the breakpoint.

I generally use defsys.lisp and lispworks&gt&gttools&gt&gtsystem browser to do builds in the LW toolchain.  That works.

Hi,

That is exactly what I thought should work, but this doesn't.

About defsys, should I keep 2 configuration files then: one asdf and
another defsys in order to debug with LW and deploy/manage external
dependencies with QL?

Hi,

I guess I was too fast for conclusions. Basically I can debug anything
except functions called from CAPI, i.e. I cannot debug callbacks or
different color-function/column-function etc.

Hi,

Yes I'm on Cocoa and it looks like this problem is Cocoa specific. The
"spawning" another thread for UI doesn't work either. I can however
do the "printf-debugging", i.e. format produces output to the output
window, but it feels rather old-scool for expensive IDE, one of the selling
point of which is a UI framework and good IDE including a graphical
debugger :\

I guess however there could be some technical way to do the debugging anyway, like
gdbserver for C or swank/slime.

&gt Hmmm, I can set a breakpoint on, say a menu callback and have it break.
&gt
&gt I'm using LWL7 Pro (linux).
&gt
&gt Oh, wait, you are using Cocoa.  Isn't there something "odd" with Cocoa - 
&gt I haven't used it yet (I haven't used the LWM debugger yet).  I seem to remember
&gt there being some restriction imposed by Apple - only one process for all UI's
&gt (or for all UI's belonging to one app)???
&gt
&gt If that's the case, then maybe someone more familiar with LWM can answer?
&gt
&gt Does "printf" debugging work in LWM - "(format ...)" to the "output window" of
&gt the LW repl?  Or, maybe you can spawn another "app" using the MP: package and
&gt have it accept debug messages???  Maybe you can use the "process browser" tool
&gt of LW to see if you are successfully spawning new apps.
