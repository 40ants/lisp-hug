Hi,

How to determine if particular symbol is a type? i.e. 'fixnum, or
graphics-ports:transform?

For example in SBCL we have sb-ext:valid-type-specifier-p

I guess you could do

   (ignore-errors (subtypep symbol t))

Pascal Costanza provided this snippet on usenet on 18 March 2012:

(defun valid-type-specifier-p (thing)
  (ignore-errors (subtypep thing 't)))

Interestingly, the lispworks swank implementation takes a different
approach, and also supports non-symbol type specifiers:

You're feeling there's something more expressive about the second
one, because you've got the impression that there could still be
something outside of the totallity.  Nope.  as types, T and NIL are
perfect complements, and there's nothing outside of them (and since
there's nothing inside NIL, there's nothing outside of T).  By
definition.

As for them to be equivalent, in the abstract way, of course;  but I
could imagine an implementation giving different results.  Happily, sbcl
is consistent there, but given that it assumes any unknown symbol is a
type, I would not have been surprised if it had returned T for (subtypep
'foo 't) but NIL for (subtypep 'nil 'foo).

Ie. in (subtypep u k), the unknown is u (what you are usually testing),
while the known is k and is expected to be a type. Which makes me feel
(subtypep a-type 't) safer than (subtypep 'nil a-type).

But the specification eventually resolves on the term "membership" in
this glossary entry:

     subtype n. a type whose membership is the same as or a proper
     subset of the membership of another type, called a
     supertype. (Every type is a subtype of itself.)

and it's not defined, therefore we can take it to mean the usual
mathematical membership, and it can be read both ways.

            A ⊆ B ⇔ B ⊇ A

Thanks guys! Works perfectly.
