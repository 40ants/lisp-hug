                <h1>CAPI and SLIME on Mac OS X</h1>
                <pre>
Hello,

I was wondering if anyone has had success with developing CAPI
applications on OS X with SLIME. I'm using LispWorks Hobbyist DV
64-bit.

The biggest problem is with dialogs. Any keyboard input is captured by
the parent process and not the CAPI input pane. This makes it very
difficult to interactively development interactive applications.

The second problem is with menus. Once again, the parent process model
seems to be at fault here.

To remedy these problems, I tried launching a Swank server from within
the LispWorks IDE and connecting to it with SLIME from Emacs. This
works well for about one or two minutes before the remote Swank
process begins to timeout commands. Evaluation is often delayed by
10-15 seconds, and all SLIME features cease to work due to the
excessive pausing incurred during the remote communication. If I
switch to the LispWorks listener, SLIME will become responsive again
for a few seconds, but this performance quickly dissipates once I'm
back in Emacs.

I would happy to use an embedded Swank server in LispWorks as a
solution to this problem, so if anyone can tell me how to make it work
without deadlock, I would be forever grateful.

Please help me! :)

Thank you,
Adrian
