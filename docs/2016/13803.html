&gt Hi David, you might find this paper on the history of the development

&gt &gt I just ran across Dybvig’s PhD Thesis
&gt &gt &lt;http://agl.cs.unm.edu/~williams/cs491/three-imp.pdf&gt. In the

&gt &gt and stack-based implementations for a Lisp-like language (Scheme).

Thanks for mentioning these papers. I was familiar with Dybvig's
retrospective that Gene mentioned, but not his PhD thesis that David
pointed to. Both of you may also be interested in this paper on the
nanopass compiler framework approach (if you haven't seen it already):
&lt;http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~dyb/pubs/nano-jfp.pdf&gt

Also, as it happens, Chez Scheme was open sourced by Cisco earlier
today!: &lt;https://github.com/cisco/ChezScheme&gt. The nanopass framework is
used in Chez Scheme, but is also a separate project, the References
section of the README has bibliographic notes on newer papers than the
JFP article mentioned above, see
&lt;https://github.com/nanopass/nanopass-framework-scheme&gt
