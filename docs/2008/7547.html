Hi Edi,

it could be a good idea to put a "close" button into your pane...

Isn't it a little bit illogic (at least semantically) to reuse an
interface already destroyed ? Why not simply keep the main layout and
reuse it with a fresh interface ? For my own I never use the
"make-interface" method for the reason that, in my mind, the
interface-content must sometime be reusable, but the interface itself
is always a one-use-only object. Maybe this feeling is wrong, but in
this case I find the "destroy-interface" method's name ambigous.

Cordialement

Denis

&gt The attached bogus test code works for me (LWW 5.0.2).  Its main
&gt purpose is to demonstrate how an interface is created and "displayed"
&gt with state :HIDDEN, then modified, then destroyed, and then
&gt immediately re-used by CAPI:DISPLAY-DIALOG.
&gt
&gt What I'd like to know is if this is permitted as a general technique
&gt or if it will break in mysterious ways for more complicated cases.
&gt I'm aware that probably only LispWorks can give an affirmative answer,
&gt but maybe some of you have already tried something like this and can
&gt comment on it.
&gt
&gt In case you're wondering what I need this for: The interface needs to
&gt be an application-modal dialog eventually but between the time it is
&gt created and its life as a dialog there are certain (a lot, actually)
&gt things that have to be done to it some of which can only be performed
&gt on an interface which is "displayed" (as by CAPI:DISPLAY).
&gt
&gt If this "re-use" approach doesn't work, I have several other
&gt alternatives I could try, so it's not a big deal, but I'm still
&gt curious if this is a valid usage of CAPI or totally off the mark.

See the reply I just sent to Denis.  I think you have to make a
distinction between the CLOS objects and what they represent.

My understanding from the CAPI manuals (see specifically "1.3 The CAPI
model" in the CAPI User Guide) is that it is /not/ illogic as the CLOS
INTERFACE object is just a "proxy" to the underlying "thing" the
windowing system uses.  As you'll know, the CLOS object is still there
even after you've destroyed an interface.  You can still inspect it.
My idea of how this works is that if you call CAPI:DISPLAY or
CAPI:DISPLAY-INTERFACE again, a new windowing object "thing" will be
created if necessary.

Of course, I'm not sure if this interpretation is correct.  That's why
I'm asking here.

:)

FWIW, my interface objects have lots of slots with interesting
information.  If I just keep the main layout, I have to copy all these
slots to a new interface.

MAKE-INTERFACE?  You mean MAKE-INSTANCE?  What do you use instead?

Yes, probably.

Yes, I also had the impression that some things are different when you
use DISPLAY-DIALOG instead of DISPLAY.  For example, I think there's
no new thread on Windows (which makes sense) and consequently the top
level hook is ignored.  I wonder if that's documented somewhere and I
missed it.

It's simply because the dialog I got with your code is modal and I
didn't find a way to close it... so I had to force LW to quit.

Excuse-me I was confused, I thought about 'define-interface.

Starting from the point of view that a window is a non reusable object
(witch is what I thought), my approach is to store interesting (and
persistent) information in layout slots rather than in interface
slots. Each time a window is open a method creates and displays it.
This method calls another method witch (maybe) create the main-layout.
For some persistent interfaces, this second method creates the layout
only if it doesn't already exist : otherwise, the same layout is
reused. When the interface is closed, 'change-class' is possibly used
to reduce the information contained by the layout to the strict
minimum (by changing his class to a mixin "pure storage" class).
Because of this methodology (witch is certainly not a model, but works
well for me), the definition of both interface and content in a single
method is not the best way for me.

But these considerations are maybe too far of the specific case you
invoke. Excuse me if it's the case.

Sincerely

Denis

Addendum, in case someone else wants to do this:

This technique seems to work fine in my app so far.  However, there's
a subtle bug in my example code which took me some time to hunt down.
/After/ the hidden interface is destroyed and /before/ it is
re-displayed as a dialog, you have to set its interface state to
:RESTORE.  The dialog will be shown even if you don't do that, but
when it is dismissed, strange things might happen.  In my case,
another, seemingly unrelated, dialog was also closed.
