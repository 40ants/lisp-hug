Hi, ndl

Is it possible to generate loadable lisp patchs from LW Editor's  
Changed Definitions facility, just like the old Lisp Machine time?  
Recently I read some Symbolics documents, there's a "Patch Facility"  
in Symbolics' defsystem, seems quite advance.

I'm interesting in how LispWorks' patch (public &amp; private) bundle be  
made for a long time. I don't think these patch files are hand-wrote.

Regards,

Chun Tian (binghe)

&gt
&gt This binding allows access from LWW to the Perforce SCM
&gt (http://www.perforce.com/). It's been almost 5 years since I released
&gt 0.1 so I reckoned it was time for an upgrade.
&gt
&gt New at 0.2:
&gt
&gt   * Improved presentation for "p4 opened"
&gt   * Add "p4 revert"
&gt   * Process P4CONFIG file (so you can work with multiple repositories)
&gt   * Improved albeit incomplete support for filenames containing spaces
&gt   * Incorporates latest version of p4com.dll
&gt
&gt I've been using this daily for years. If I have any other users out
&gt there I'll be pleased to hear from them as it might improve the
&gt chances of there ever being a 0.3

 &gt 
 &gt There's a strong argument that this facility did not necessarily serve
 &gt its owners well, so if you come across one use it with care. In
 &gt particular, make sure you can always continue to build your system
 &gt from scratch (i.e. that a force compilation into a clean image will
 &gt succeed).

You could always build the deployed version of the system from
scratch, since you could ask for a particular version of the
source code of a given system.   (The patch facility included
version control.)  Whether or not the *latest* version of the
source code would compile is another matter, outside the
scope of a source control facility.

 &gt Also, what you change in the source is not always what or how you
 &gt patch in the field. Human intervention - at least to review the change
 &gt and consider how it will behave - is always required.

The patch facility included a workflow for review and signoff 
of changes; that's what the "Reviewed By" and "Approved" things 
in the version/stream part of the system were about.

In my view, which is largely based on experience with CVS, 
it's too bad modern systems don't have some of the features
and integration with the IDE that we had 20 years ago.

How is this different from people checking in changes to CVS
that wind up breaking the system?  That's what happens almost
all the time in the environments I've worked in.

 &gt Indeed. In addition to what you listed, there are the users of changed
 &gt macros and inline functions to consider. You must also arrange for the
 &gt appropriate optimize qualities to be in effect at patch compile time,
 &gt along with any (EVAL-WHEN (:COMPILE-TOPLEVEL ...)) forms. So there are
 &gt important considerations outside of the source code you actually edited.

Yes, the system needs to track all the callers, and be aware of the
optimize settings (just like it's aware of the file-global attributes
like the readtable).  It certainly doesn't work to just look at some text;
it has to have extensive side information somewhere.

 &gt I believe (maybe someone who was there can clarify) that this is

When I was there we rebuilt the system regularly, but there
was some magical bootstrapping that only a few people knew.
The patch system was a set of software managment tools for
controlling and auditing source changes, tools for partially
automating creation of comprehensive and less buggy changes, 
for documented change histories and live version control,
and for deploying patches to the field.

Where I come from, we call that "a Good thing"!
Could always be better, though!

&gt huzzah! I can consider myself under no obligation to do any more work
&gt on this.
&gt
&gt Question: is anyone reading this (other than me) a Perforce user?

Me too.

Incidentally I have just uncovered a memory leak in the p4com.dll which
causes it to leak a copies of the strings it sends back.  This is
unlikely to hurt typical interactive use, but I have a server using it
that was slowly starving itself of memory.

I'll be sending a patch off to Robert Cowham (p4com.dll author) once it
is tested...
