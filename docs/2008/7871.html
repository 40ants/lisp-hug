                <h1>last evaluated result..</h1>
                <pre>
Hi List,

I would like to evaluate the contents of a text buffer that I created  
(editor::make-buffer) independently from an editor pane, and to get  
the last evaluated result.

The following code evaluates the contents of the buffer :

(editor::with-point ((p1 (editor::buffers-start textbuffer))
                            (p2 (editor::buffers-end textbuffer)))
         (editor::region-eval textbuffer p1 p2 :print t))


... but it returns nil, as well as the variable  editor::*last- 
evaluate-result*

Does anyone knows how to find this last result ?

Many thanks,

Jean

Don't have time to play with this just at the moment, but one thing
that might work is: make a string out of the buffer, wrap a (PROGN
....) around it, read-from-string, and eval.  Just a thought.
