1.
Why is it that whenever I invoke the following command:

  Works -&gt Tools -&gt Preferences -&gt Font -&gt Select Font

I get an error, with the message

  Illegal junk found in "7l" from 0 to 2, by
  parse-integer.

And I am presented with a single restart

  (abort) Return to event loop

What went wrong? Is it my X configuration?


2.
Has anybody experienced running LispWorks from the network?

I'm trying to run LispWorks from an X tunnel via SSH.  It seems
to load well, but then I use some of the tools, like the Window
Browser, I get a dialog box saying something like the following:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
X ERROR
  Display: #&lt;X-LIBRARY:DISPLAY "localhost:10.0" = #x0817E800&gt
  Error: BadGC (invalid GC parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request: 59 (X_SetClipRectangles)
  ResourceID: 0x1A00281 (27263617)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

With only an OK button. Now when I click that button, another window
with the same contents appear, and so on. And the only way (so far)
that I know to stop it is to kill LispWorks altogether.

Is it an X problem? Is it because of the tunnel? What have I
missed? It works well however, when ran locally.

Thanks in advance. :-)

I have not tried Lispworks over ssh, but I have had problems running
some programs over ssh using ssh's dedicated X forwarding.  For some
programs, you can workaround by forwarding X using normal ssh port
forwarding, e.g.

  % ssh -R 6001:localhost:6000 host
  % export DISPLAY=localhost:1
  % your_program

I don't know why this works.  :(

And, of course, this may or may not help with Lispworks.

Looks like an X/ssh problem.  You should make sure that forwarding of
X11 packets is enabled on both the client and the server side.

Ok. I'll try it again and post updates.

How did you run it from the network?

Given that you see /something/ at least, I'd say that your best bet is
to try with another client and/or another X server first to see if you
have the same problems then.  Or maybe it's just a matter of the
window manager settings.  Which combination are you currently using?

I tried using some of our workstations in our network, and it works fine.

Currently, I'm using this:

host1$ ssh -X host2
host2$ lispworks

I've also tried changing window managers, but I still get the same behavior.
I hope somebody could point out what's causing the problem.

I haven't seen exactly that error message as a symptom of this, but I
/think/ this may be related to trusted vs. untrusted X11 forwarding -
if your client ssh version is OpenSSH 3.8 or later.

Try ssh -Y instead of ssh -X and see what happens! (And RTFM so you
know what you're doing :-))

Nice! -Y works. Yes, I'll RTFM.
