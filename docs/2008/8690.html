                <h1>Waiting for (some) input available?</h1>
                <pre>
I have a socket stream and I'd like to use READ-SEQUENCE on it when
there's some data available. However, I don't want to wait until there's
necessarily a full sequence's worth of data available. I think I want
something like this:

  - (setf socket (open-tcp-stream ... :read-timeout 0))

  - (setf buffer (make-array 1024 :element-type '(unsigned-byte 8)))

  - (some-waiting-function socket)

  - (read-sequence buffer socket)

The last step would immediately read some pending octets from the
socket, if there were any. 

I don't think I want a read-timeout of nil on the stream, since that
seems to wait until the buffer is completely full.

What should I do in place of some-waiting-function? Or is there some
other approach to read whatever's available on a socket, regardless of
the amount of data it might be?

wait-for-input-streams-returning-first  seems like it's what you are  
after.
