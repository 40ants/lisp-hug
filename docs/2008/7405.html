                <h1>Filtering characters into CAPI text-input-pane</h1>
                <pre>
Thanks again for the list for the great help with the title in frame
information. The application is coming along well, but there is a
feature I'd like to implement and I wonder how to best accomplish
that.

I'd like to have a text-input-pane that will only accept
positive, floating-point numbers. That is, characters [0-9\.]
The :confirm-change-function looks perfect for the job of restricting
non-numeric characters, but is only implemented on Motif.

One potential work around I though of is that when the input is done,
and if there are invalid characters, to blank the field, beep, and
reset focus to the field. Another work-around is to use
text-input-range, but that only supports integers.

My first preference is to just prevent invalid characters from being
entered in this first place. Since :confirm-change-function isn't
available on all platforms, is there another possibility that I'm not
seeing, like applying a filter to stream of input characters?

Thanks in advance for any ideas,

Kevin

Try change-callback.

Look at the examples/elements/text-input-pane.lisp.  I think that the example 
does kind-of what you want (it prevents typing of more than 20 chars).

Kevin,

Why not use the change-callback for text-input-pane?

It's called every time the text or caret position is changed. You can  
filter and replace the text, along with the caret position. (See CAPI  
Reference Manual for text-input-pane.)
