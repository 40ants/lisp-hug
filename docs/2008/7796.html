Hi there.

Yesterday I tried to install Edi's starter pack on vista to no avail.  
During the compilation it goes something like "the path #P"c:\home..."  
(not sure about the exact path) is not found. It was working fine on the  
xp.

Any ideas?

There is a problem when loading cl-who. I can see this error too, it  
says

The directory "home" does not exist in #P"C:/home/".

That was not a Vista vs. XP issue but simply a mistake I made.  I've
uploaded a new release which should fix that.  Please test.

Thanks for the report,
Edi.
