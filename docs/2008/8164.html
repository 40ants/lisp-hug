Hi List

In case someone would have experience with drag and drop in  
LispWorks / MacOS...

Is there a way to prevent the clicked object's window to come to the  
front immediately, i.e. to do as in the MacOS Finder when dragging a  
file icon from window to another: the windows order remains the same  
during drag and drop operations, and the clicked window comes to the  
front only in case of a simple click (not a drag-init). ?

Thanks for any hint,
Jean Bresson

                 <pre>
Hi,
I try again with another drag &amp; drop issue...

I would like to make the "alt" key set the drag operation to "copy",  
or in general, to make the LW drag &amp; drop manager  dynamically handle  
the standard move / copy commands ?

During drag operations, the drop-callback function of capi::output- 
pane always gives me
(capi:drop-object-drop-effect drop-object)  --&gt :none
(Maybe at this stage it should yet give the value corresponding the  
current operation (copy, move, or link) depending on the OS defaults  
and current keys configuration?)

Following the code provided in LW 5.1 examples, it seems however that  
one has to set manually (capi:drop-object-drop-effect drop-object)  
either to :move, :copy, or :link. But as there is no way to know if  
alt key is pressed or not, or to update special keys configuration  
chacking during the drag process, then it is not possible to set  
the :copy operation accordingly.

Thanks for any help !

Jean Bresson
