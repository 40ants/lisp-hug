                <h1>Copying a file ?</h1>
                <pre>
How do I copy a file in Lispworks? I am on XP, so I thought something like 

(win32:CopyFileEx "c:\\Foo1.jpg" "c:\\Foo2.jpg" nil nil ...)

Which it obviously doesn't like, because it seems to lack CopyFileEx in the 
Win32 package but I saw no command for copying a file.

Thanks,

William

It's not hard to write such a function yourself (open input file, open
output file, read from input, write to output).

Googling for "copy file" "common lisp" will return several possible
implementations, for example http://www.weitz.de/cl-fad/

How about just ccl::copy-file

&gt P.S. anyone knows where the name "CCL" come from? Seems many CLs has

I think it was originally used by Coral Common Lisp, which became
Macintosh Allegro Common Lisp, which became Macintosh Common Lisp,
which became OpenMCL, which became Clozure Lisp :-)

At least I remember that the first version of MACL had this package,
and I thought that was a heritage from CCL.
