                <h1>Some editor questions</h1>
                <pre>
I have some questions regarding the editor, to which I haven't
found the answers myself, so I decided to post it here.

1) What are the shortcut keys for the tools? The manual says
that they're bound to Meta+Control keys, so for the editor it's
Meta+Control+e right? It doesn't work with me. I checked my
X settings and my "Alt" keys are bound to "Meta".

2) How do I make "regions" visible? In Emacs, it's called
transient-mark-mode.

3) How do I change the font lock colors? I looked at fontlock.lisp
and I did a SETF on say *FONT-LOCK-STRING-FACE* but it
didn't seem to work.

4) When scrolling past the topmost or bottommost line in a buffer,
how do I change the behavior of the editor so that it won't recenter
the cursor?

Thanks.

I looked at Edi Weitz's lw-add-ons and saw hints at the command
"Tools Listener".

&gt 2) How do I make "regions" visible? In Emacs, it's called

&gt

Same, lw-add-ons.

&gt and I did a SETF on say *FONT-LOCK-STRING-FACE* but it
&gt didn't seem to work.
&gt

I was looking at a more Emacs-ish way but I found that there was
a menu command it the Works -&gt Tools -&gt Preferences menu that
does what I want.

&gt 4) When scrolling past the topmost or bottommost line in a buffer,
&gt how do I change the behavior of the editor so that it won't recenter

&gt

I don't know the answer to this yet. Any hints, guys?

&gt Thanks.

&gt
&gt     Try
&gt     
&gt     (setf (editor:variable-value 'editor::scroll-step) !)
&gt
&gt I didn't see a change in behavior when I did that.

That's probably (which worked for me):

(setf (editor:variable-value 'editor::scroll-step) 1)

Thanks, Martin!
