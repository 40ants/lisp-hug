                <h1>Fast 64 bit hash?</h1>
                <pre>

I'm looking for a fast 64 bit hashing function for hash table lookups.
I really only need it for arrays of (unsigned-byte 8).

Does anyone know of such a thing?

I have been using one of Bob Jenkins' hashes (see
http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/index.html) that I re-coded in Lisp,
but I'm not really getting the performance I want.  This is mostly due
to my lack of skill of creating optimized Lisp code.

Any pointers appreciated.

Cheers,
Chris Dean

Hi Chris,

If you don't find a better solution, please post the code so that we  
can all throw declare bombs at it until it screams (both for mercy and  
is really fast).

Sure thing.  At the moment it is needlessly complex and baroque, but
I'll post it if I don't hear of a good solution.

&gt might be sufficient.

I actually need just the hashing function, not a hash-table.
Basically the equivalent of sxhash for (array (unsigned-byte 8) (*))

We have a disk based database that uses that 64 bit hash.  Similar to
the Berkeley DB hash databses.

The builtin LispWorks hash-table works great, and I do use equalp
hash-tables :).

Have you looked at Fowler-Noll-Vo (FNV) hash?
http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/fnv/index.html

&gtFrom the "History section":
"FNV hashes are designed to be fast while maintaining a low collision
rate. The FNV speed allows one to quickly hash lots of data while
maintaining a reasonable collision rate. The high dispersion of the
FNV hashes makes them well suited for hashing nearly identical strings
such as URLs, hostnames, filenames, text, IP addresses, etc. "

I don't have a Lisp implementation sitting around, but it's a pretty
short, straightforward algo.

That's great, thanks.  I'll take a look.
