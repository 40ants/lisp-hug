&gt Now, to-date, this has been fine for me since I've only been using  
&gt the listener. I open my package, compile, open my program, compile,  
&gt test away, and the world is good. However, when using delivery to  
&gt compile, it fails:
&gt
&gt (compile-file "mypackage.lisp" :load t)
&gt (compile-file "myprogram.lisp" :load t)
&gt
&gt
&gt It dies because myprogram.lisp shadows symbols declared in

No, it will read the file form by form.

&gt Because of this, my USE-PACKAGE call at the start of myprogram.lisp  
&gt doesn't actually eval until *after* all the symbols have been  
&gt interned. But that's just a guess right now.

&gt My "hack" so far to get around this has been to insert (use- 
&gt package :my-package) in between the calls to COMPILE-FILE in the  
&gt delivery script. This works, but it feels like an unnecessary  
&gt workaround due to my own ignorance right now.
&gt
&gt Can anyone shed some light on what I should be doing?

Let me have a guess...

The Lisp compiler sees the forms, but it only compiles them - it does  
not execute them - usually. So, if you have a form
in the file that the compiler should execute, you need to tell the  
compiler to do so. EVAL-WHEN does that.

(eval-when (:compile-toplevel :load-toplevel :execute)
    (use-package :my-package))

Above tells the compiler to execute the form. You might also want to  
tell which package should use :my-package.
USE-PACKAGE uses as default the value of *package*:

   (use-package :my-package :my-other-package)
