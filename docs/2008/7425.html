The CLHS entry for IGNORE[1] says

  The stream variables established by with-open-file, with-open-stream,
  with-input-from-string, and with-output-to-string, and all /iteration
  variables/ are, by definition, always ``used''. Using (declare (ignore
  v)), for such a variable v has unspecified consequences.

And an /iteration variable/ is a binding established by one of

  do              do-external-symbols  dotimes  
  do*             do-symbols           loop     
  do-all-symbols  dolist                        

All implementations, that I've tested, got this at least partially
wrong, although I've not tested on all implementations that I've sent
this mail to. (Kudos to the implementation that get this totally right!)

There's even a whole issue write up about this [2] where the following
test case was adapted from:

  (DEFUN COMPILER-WARNINGS-P (BODIES &amp;OPTIONAL (FLAG NIL))
    (MAPCAR #'(LAMBDA (BODY)
		(FLET ((TRY (BODY)
			 (LET ((WARNING 
				(WITH-OUTPUT-TO-STRING (*ERROR-OUTPUT*)
				  (COMPILE NIL `(LAMBDA ,@BODY)))))
			   (IF FLAG WARNING (&gt (LENGTH WARNING) 0)))))
		  (LIST (TRY BODY)
			(TRY (LIST (CAR BODY)
				   (REMOVE-IF
				    #'(LAMBDA (X)
					(AND (NOT (ATOM X))
					     (EQ (CAR X) 'DECLARE)))
				    (CADR BODY)))))))
	    BODIES)))

  (DEFUN TEST-CASE ()
    (COMPILER-WARNINGS-P
     '(((X) (DOTIMES (A X) (DECLARE (IGNORE A)) (PRINT 'FOO)))
       ((X) (DOLIST (A X) (DECLARE (IGNORE A)) (PRINT 'FOO)))
       ((X) (DO-SYMBOLS (S X) (DECLARE (IGNORE S)) (PRINT 'FOO)))
       ((X) (DO-EXTERNAL-SYMBOLS (S X) (DECLARE (IGNORE S)) (PRINT 'FOO)))
       (()  (DO-ALL-SYMBOLS (S) (DECLARE (IGNORE S)) (PRINT 'FOO)))
       ;; Illegal DECLARE position. -TCR.
       ; ((X) (LOOP FOR I IN X DO (DECLARE (IGNORE I)) (PRINT 'FOO)))
       ; ((X) (LOOP FOR L ON X DO (DECLARE (IGNORE L)) (PRINT 'FOO)))
       ((X) (DO ((L X X)) (NIL) (DECLARE (IGNORE L)) (PRINT 'FOO)))
       ((X) (DO* ((L X X)) (NIL) (DECLARE (IGNORE L)) (PRINT 'FOO)))
       ((x) (with-input-from-string (v x) (declare (ignore v)) (print 'foo)))
       ((x) (with-output-to-string (v x) (declare (ignore v)) (print 'foo)))
       ((x) (with-open-stream (v x) (declare (ignore v)) (print 'foo)))
       ((x) (with-open-file (v x) (declare (ignore v)) (print 'foo))))))

(test-case) will return a list like

  ((T NIL) (NIL T) ...)

where the first sublist corresponds to the first test case enumerated in
TEST-CASE's definition. The first element of that sublist is T if a
style-warning was emitted with the IGNORE declaration, the second
element is T if a style-warning was emitted without the IGNORE
declaration.

I.e. the above example would mean that there was style-warning signalled for

  (DOTIMES (A X) (DECLARE (IGNORE A)) (PRINT 'FOO))

but not for

  (DOTIMES (A X) (PRINT 'FOO))

Optimally, the result an implementation should return is a list of 
(T NIL)s.

 It _must not_ return a list where any sublist is of the form (FOO T) as
this would mean that style-warning was signalled without a IGNORE
declaration, which is against the above quote from CLHS.

(I assume that any style-warning emitted is a style-warning concerning
good or bad use of a IGNORE declaration.)

  -T.
