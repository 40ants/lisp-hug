Adding the following updated index pages in specials.lisp will get the 
index working with LWW 5.1.  There is a warning involving 
editor::rubber-streams which I would like to know how to fix.

That's in lw-doc, not lw-add-ons.

Versions of both lw-add-ons and lw-doc which work with LW 5.1 are
already online on my server.  If you get warnings with these new
versions, please let me know.

Congratulations!  I had the pleasure of being one of the beta testers
and I have to say I was very impressed by the amount of new features.
Almost too many for a 0.1 version increase... :)

&gt * LispWorks as a dynamic library

If someone wants to play with the new shared libraries on OS X, they
might want to look at the current release of FM-PLUGIN-TOOLS:

Also very nice... :)

I haven't spent too much time with this release yet but I'm enjoying  
some of these new features a great deal already. Thanks for 5.1, and  
I'm sure I speak for many here when I say thanks to the LispWorks crew  
for all your hard work.

warmest regards,
