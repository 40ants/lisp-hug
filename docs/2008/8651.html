Hi Chris,

this might seem a bit odd recommendation :)

I while back I had to do some image processing for my own app. I had to convert some dozend pictures and generate some hundered
output images in different formats and color schemes etc. I used the command line interface of Image Magick. Just used LispWorks as
'batch processor'.

Regards

Andreas

&gt Subject: resizing image files.
&gt 
&gt 
&gt 
&gt I need to read in some JPEG files (and perhaps GIF, PNG),  size them
&gt down, possibly crop, and save them back out again (possibly switching 
&gt GIF to JPEG, vice versa) to a different path.
&gt 
&gt 
&gt For some reason I am convinced that I used the LispWorks GP
&gt library to 
&gt do this years ago when playing around with  LispWorks 4.  And, sure 
&gt enough, it seems tantalizingly close. But I can't find my toy 
&gt code from 
&gt years back and I can't quite seem to find the functions I 
&gt want in the LW 
&gt docs.    Does anyone have any advice, pointers, or sample code?
&gt 
&gt I'm not using CAPI in my current project, and I do not need
&gt to display 
&gt these images. Maybe that's my blind spot, perhaps what I'm 
&gt looking for 
&gt is there.  If anyone has  some guidance I'd appreciate it.
&gt 
&gt Chris
&gt 
&gt 
&gt P.S. There seem to be quite a few different common lisp image
&gt libraries 
&gt (ch-image, imago, etc.). I couldn't get ch-image to compile 
&gt under LW5.  
&gt Haven't looked at the others yet. If you know of one that'll work in 
&gt LispWorks and do what I need, let me know.
