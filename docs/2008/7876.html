                <h1>string encoding for pathnames. FSRef?</h1>
                <pre>
I'm using Mac LispWorks 5 and am passing some data back and forth with 
another process over a socket.   Both LW and the other process are 
running on the same machine.

Some of the data that is being passed are pathnames to files. I've been 
having a bit of trouble with pathnames that contain non-ASCII 
characters. It turns out that the other process  is using a variety of 
string encodings (UTF8, MacRoman) and varying between precomposed and 
decomposed unicode. So now I'm trying to make everything consistent and 
fix it.

What is the encoding LispWorks uses for its strings? Such as can be used 
to construct a pathname object or passed to (probe-file). 



Alternately, rather than the inconsistent paths I currently am 
accessing, I have the option of getting a Mac FSRef. That really seems 
ideal. But, I'd need to transmit it across the socket to LispWorks and 
then get LW to make a valid pathname object.  An FSRef is an opaque 80 
byte entity. I have no idea if it is portable across processes (both are 
on the same machine, though).  But, if it were, is there any way I can 
get LispWorks to embrace it?

Any advice on this matter is welcome.

P.S.  I haven't worked much with string encoding in the past. If I have 
a pathname with arabic characters in, for example, is that even 
expressible with a string using MacRoman encoding? What about ISOLatin? 
UTF8?

LW can decode a variety of formats, but you have to know what you are  
decoding. If the files are all really paths on the same machine, how  
is it that some would be UTF8 while others are MacRoman? I thought the  
OS would represent them the same way. Unless perhaps they are stored  
in a database or something from different OS versions.

If I recall correctly, MacRoman is similar to Latin1 which is a subset  
of UTF8. If the encodings are really different, I think there should  
be a small number of bytes to compare to determine if you have one or  
the other.

Here is a way to convert UTF-8 byte stream to a lisp string:

(defun translate-string-via-fli (string from to)
   (fli:with-foreign-string (ptr elements bytes :external-format from)
       string
     (declare (ignore elements bytes))
     (fli:convert-from-foreign-string ptr :external-format to)))


(defun decode-external-string (string)
   (translate-string-via-fli string :latin-1 :utf-8))

You can call Carbon FSRef related functions. For example,

(fli:define-foreign-function (CFURLCreateFromFSRef  
"CFURLCreateFromFSRef" :source)
     ((allocator :pointer)
      (fs-ref :pointer))
   :result-type :pointer
   :language :c)

This gives you a CFURL which you can convert to a file system path.  
Something like this:

(defun cf-url-file-system-path (url &amp;optional (path-style +posix-path- 
style+))
   (let ((cf-string (CFURLCopyFileSystemPath url path-style)))
     (unless (fli:null-pointer-p cf-string)
       (prog1 (%string cf-string) ;(cf-string-to-lisp-string cf-string)
         (CFRelease cf-string)))))

UTF8, yes, MacRoman or Latin-X, no.
