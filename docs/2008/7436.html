                <h1>Scrolling disabled collector panes</h1>
                <pre>
I have a collector pane that I just use to show some program output to
the user and thus it is disabled.  Unfortunately, as a result of that,
you can't scroll the pane anymore.  How can I have both, a /disabled/
collector pane, but also the ability to scroll up if some its contents
have disappeared?

Thanks,
Edi.



  (capi:define-interface application-interface ()
    ()
    (:panes
     (log-pane
      capi:collector-pane
      :enabled nil
      :accessor application-log-pane))
    ;; etc.

Hello Edi,

To retain the scrollable property, I would suggest setting the pane buffer
read-only instead of disabling the pane:

 (setf (editor:buffer-writable (capi:editor-pane-buffer log-pane)) nil)
