                <pre>
Hi, LispWorks Users

I'm pleased to release the version 4.0 of LispWorks-UDP! I call it "a  
big step":)

Major changes in this release:

  * Move all source code from COMM to "COMM+" package, which stop the  
hacking of COMM.
    All external symbols of COMM is also exported to new COMM+  
package, the compatibility of
    LW's TCP facility didn't break, so just change your code to COMM+  
will works.

  * UNIX Domain Socket support is added but only as a client. Server  
support is not finished yet.
    Both stream and datagram socket are supported, for stream socket,  
LW's COMM:SOCKET-STREAM
    can be used the same as TCP socket, for datagram, you can use SEND- 
MESSAGE and
    RECEIVE-MESSAGE the same as UDP socket in LispWorks-UDP.

  * WAIT-FOR-INPUT function from USOCKET project is ported into  
LispWorks-UDP. This function
    is quite useful for waiting the sockets which available of READ.  
With it, the
    SOCKET-RECEIVE-TIMEOUT may not needed to set.
    Note: currently only non-win32 platform is supported. TCP  
compatibility is not added.

  * Encapsulation datagram socket (both UDP and unix) into CLOS classes:
    INET-DATAGRAM, and UNIX-DATAGRAM, both of them are subclass of  
SOCKET-DATAGRAM,
    All interface function operates on instances of above classes  
instead of raw socket fd.
    This changes can be easier to add property or status slot for  
datagram sockets
    and make sure they're closed when being GCed.

Incompatible API changes:

  * [API Change] SEND-MESSAGE and RECEIVE-MESSAGE's optional arguments  
become keyword arguments

  * [API Change] RECEIVE-MESSAGE's 3rd return value (remote-address)  
is a 32bit integer now,
    If you want to string-like IPv4 address, call COMM:IP-ADDRESS- 
STRING yourself.

  * [API Change] SET-SOCKET-RECEIVE-TIMEOUT and GET-SOCKET-RECEIVE- 
TIMEOUT change name to
                 SOCKET-RECEIVE-TIMEOUT and (SETF SOCKET-RECEIVE- 
TIMEOUT)

For sample usage, see TEST.LISP in source code.
For full API documentation, see README in source code.

(The LispWorks-UDP 3.x is still maintained but 2.x and 1.x will not be  
maintained ever.)

Hi again,

I'm so sorry... didn't test again on win32 before the release. Just re- 
upload the file.

Please check the size and MD5SUM of lispworks-udp_4.0.tar.gz, if not  
the same with following you should download it again (at least 4  
downloads already happen, sorry again)
