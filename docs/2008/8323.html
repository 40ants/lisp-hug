                <h1>vertical-scroll in capi:grid-layout</h1>
                <pre>
I'd like to have a grid-layout with a vertical scroll bar.  In the 
example below, when vertical-scroll is t, a space is visible for the 
vertical scroll bar even when it is not needed.  Also I am able to drag 
the window so that a region below the grid-layout is visible in the window.

Is there a way that:
1. I can eliminate the reserved space on the right when the vertical 
scroll bar is not displayed.
2. Limit the max height of the containing window to that of the grid-layout?

Thank you.

Hi Mitch,

I don't know if 1 can be achieved. I don't think so. 2. can certainly be achieved by placing the grid-layout into another one btw.
by using capi:define-interface. capi:contain is for testing purpose as far as I know. I would not use it in a program.

The following works:

(use-package :capi)

(define-interface test ()
  ()
  (:layouts
   (grid grid-layout '("Item 1" "Item 20000" "Item 30000"
                                "4" "5" "6"
                                "7" "8" "9"
                                "107" "108" "109"
                                "2001" "2008" "20019")
         :vertical-scroll t 
         :external-min-height '(character 5)
         :columns 3)))

(contain (make-instance 'test))

Thanks for looking at this. The appearance of the space for the scroll
bar when it is not needed is unusual behavior for an interface -
normally when the scroll bar is not needed, the main text area expands
where the scroll bar was.&nbsp; Maybe this should be considered a bug with
grid-layout?<br>
<br>
In your example, I am still able to resize the overall window to
increase its height past the extent of the grid.&nbsp; I have also tried
placing the grid-layout in a simple-pinboard-layout, but that does not
constrain the resizing either.<br>
