                <h1>Floating LW "bar" on LWM</h1>
                <pre>
Hi

in LWM there is this "floating bar" (the "podium" in UNIX/Linux) that  
is always on top.  This creates some annoyances when making windows  
full screen.
There are a bunch of unexported symbols in the LISPWORKS-TOOLS package  
that seem to deal with it, but, more to the point, could it be  
possible to activate a normal window bar and buttons around it?

Cheers

Marco

I don't know about changing it, but I just kill it with this in my  
init file.


(lw:define-action "CAPI Create Interface" "kill the podium" 'kill-the- 
podium)


(defun kill-the-podium (p)
   (when (eq (type-of p) 'lispworks-tools::lispworks-toolbar-window)
     (capi:quit-interface p :force t)))

I suppose you could make your own with whatever window type you want.

&gt Yes, but it is not so easy to do so.  

It's easy enough if one tries it :-)

&gt May I suggest to make it look like a regular window on LWM?

A regular window steals too much screen estate. A regular toolbox
window (is that the right mac name for it?) like the font or color
choosers would be fine, though.
