                <h1>Implementing an e-learning application</h1>
                <pre>
Dear Lispers,

we are considering, to implement an deliverable e-learning
application. This application consists of ~50 lectures with ~100
frames per lecture.  A frame consists of one or more multimedia-object
(image, video, ...) and an audio-track (mostly mp3).

So - we are thinking of building that stuff in lispworks. May I ask
you some questions or get some ideas?

1. Is it possible to start an delivered lispworks-application from a
read-only medium (f.e. cdrom or dvd) without installing libraries or
other dependencies on the target-system (average Win32)?

2. If yes, how much time takes it to start an lispworks-application
from an average cdrom-drive? Do you think it would be bearable for an
user?

3. Would you go the way of implementing the GUI with CAPI? Exspecially
because of embedding the multimedia objects. Are there any CAPI addons/ 
libraries
for embedding mp3 or video-components? Any ready to use control
components?  (I didn't find anything related in the CAPI-Manual of the
personal Lispworks edition. Just one hint on the mailing list by Edi
Weitz
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.lispworks.general/7874/match=embed+video) 
..

Or are there better ways you would suggest? CL-SDL? other Framworks?

4. Our main-target platform is windows, but we are aware of porting
this application also to MacOS - how portable ist CAPI?

Thanks in advance for all your suggestions!

best regards,

   otto

I'm not a Windows guru, but I think the answer is no if you are using  
LispWorks 5 or later. Windows XP needs some system files installed to  
run LispWorks or a delivered application.

I've found LispWorks and delivered applications to have very good  
startup time on both Mac and Windows.

On the Mac you can embed a browser in a window to do what Edi suggests  
in the above link. But there is no cross platform comprehensive API.

I don't know of any other mature Lisp GUI frameworks for this. You  
might want to look at the Mozilla framework (search for "XUL Runner")  
or WxWidgets.

Very portable. For features not covered by CAPI, you have to work in a  
lower-level, platform specific interface. A lot more work, but still  
possible.
