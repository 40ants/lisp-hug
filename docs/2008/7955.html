Hello list (and LispWorks guys),

My application uses mod_lisp 1.3 and Kevin Rosenberg's 
CL-MODLISP to talk to Apache 2.0.59 on Windows XP SP2. The 
same interface code is compiled into several different 
(console) executables, each on their own mod_lisp port.

(Hopefully most list members can now decide whether it's 
worth reading any more...)

When I run my code from Emacs/SLIME, it seems to work well. 
However, when I run the EXEs, I see access violation 
exceptions in the console (code 0xc0000005 - very familiar 
from my C++ days) when some of the requests come in (i.e. 
the simplest "ping" request works, but the other, only 
slightly more complex requests work the first time and then 
give an exception for each subsequent request). No Lisp 
errors are raised and the request seems to be handled 
correctly, but obviously I'm a bit concerned...

I have just upgraded to 5.1, but I get the same exceptions 
with 5.0 (although without the associated stack dump). I've 
made sure all the object files have been deleted and 
re-compiled, including those for the third-party libraries. 
I don't have any FLI-type stuff involved, as far as I can tell.

Has anyone else seen anything like this? I don't really have 
time to start decimating my code to see if it goes away, and 
my Lisp code does seem to be working in the meantime so at 
least I can press on. I admit this isn't the best bug report 
ever, but I just wanted to raise it to see what people say.

Cheers,

John :^P
