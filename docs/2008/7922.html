                <h1>Getting LispWorks GUI Debugger to pop up automatically</h1>
                <pre>
Hi

I would like the LispWorks GUI Debugger to pop up automatically
when an error in the Listener Window occurs.

Is there a setting to enable the GUI Debugger to start
automatically on an error? And if so - where is it?

I would also like one keystroke to "Return to top loop level 0".

Using :c with the applicable option number (which changes
every time) is quite tedious.

Kind regards

Rudi

There's this, but it doesn't work if the error happens in a listener:

  http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw51/LWRM/html/lwref-314.htm

AFAIK there's no direct way for what you want.

:TOP or :A :T both work and don't change.

Edi.

I don't know how to do that, but there's always Alt-d,s (Debug -&gt
Start Gui Debugger).  At least that's only two keystrokes (or maybe
three, depending on how you count 'em :).

(Making "Alt" work may require changes to xmodmap.  It did for me,
anyway.)

:top&lt;enter&gt works.  It's five keystrokes, but it's the same five each
time.

There's also the system:define-top-loop-command macro which allows you
to define new things at the top level.  You could make :t do the same
thing as :top, for example

Last, be aware that the Listener is just a specialized Editor.  You
can bind keystrokes for it just like you can in the Editor.  So you
could bind single keystrokes (like, say, function keys) to invoke the
graphical debugger (either by simulating Alt-d,s, or there's probably
some actual command to do the same thing), or for invoking the "return
to toplevel" restart.

HTH.
