Thanks to all who shwoed me the right way to handle errors. In fact I 
have been misled by the statement "Therefore Common Lisp provides 
standards ways to signal errors, but no standard ways to handle errors." 
on page 664 of the printed CLtL2.  So, in fact, it is better to drop the 
book and stick with the hyper spec.

Before completely discarding the classic text, consider amending it.

    "Converting CLtL2 to ANSI CL"
    http://bc.tech.coop/cltl2-ansi.htm

While these edits would not necessarily have addressed the particular  
issue of your original message, it may prevent further misdirection on  
other topics.

The point is that having multiple sources of information helps by  
providing another voice, even if you switch to one of the others going  
forward.  Some entries of the HyperSpec might seem odd without further  
context such as the history/legacy recorded in CLtL2.
