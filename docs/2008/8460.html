Hi

Will there be 64-bit Professional versions of LispWorks at some stage?

I would like to upgrade at least one of my licenses to a 64-bit version when my maintenance contracts expire, but don't need the extra stuff in the Enterprise Edition at this stage.

Thanks.
Nico

PS. This should probably go to lisp-sales@lispworks.com but I think there are other users out there that would like this question answered.

Hi Dave, and everyone else.

    DF&gt There's no plan for that.

    &gt&gt I would like to upgrade at least one of my licenses to a 64-bit
    &gt&gt version when my maintenance contracts expire, but don't need the
    &gt&gt extra stuff in the Enterprise Edition at this stage.

    DF&gt Our position is that 64-bit is an Enterprise feature.

Some time has gone, has LW changed anything vs this position since 2008?
