Hello Edi,

| 3. The "Undo" command doesn't seem to work as expected.  It only
|    performs one undo operation and then reverts it.  I'd like to have
|    the behaviour (C-x u) I have in the normal CAPI editor.  What am I
|    doing wrong?

I think you need a bit more than just the standard "Undo". The following
works for me:

(editor:defcommand "Grid Undo"  (p) "" ""
  (let ((pane (editor::current-editor-pane)))
    (if (ywi:undo-buffer-empty-p (capi:editor-pane-buffer pane))
        (let ((grid (capi:element-interface pane)))
          (%revert-cell grid (current-record grid) (current-column grid))
          (beep))
        (editor:undo-command p))))

(defun undo-buffer-empty-p (buffer)
 ;;; Test whether the editor "Undo" command will do nothing
  ;; Use the accessor EDITOR::BUFFER-UNDO to get the undo slot of the editor
buffer.
  ;; The value is usually an object of type SYSTEM:RING (but can be NIL
initially).
  ;; Args:  buffer - editor's buffer.
  ;; Value: True iff the "Undo" command will do nothing
  (let ((undo (EDITOR::BUFFER-UNDO buffer)))
    (if (sys:ringp undo)
        (let ((bound (sys::ring-bound undo)))
          (or (minusp bound) (= (sys::ring-v-pop undo) bound)))
        t)))

Before you even get to this, you need to ensure your editor pane has  
the focus. It gets more complicated when your interface has a mixture  
of editor panes and text fields. I have several levels of edit-cut- 
enabled methods that start at the interface level and filters down  
based on what pane has the focus.


&gt 2. Is the test which enables the "Paste" menu entry (which checks the
&gt   clipboard) the right one?

I'm not doing that, but have a note that I should be :).

I think this is all I'm doing and I get multiple-undo. I have not  
implemented a "Redo" option.

(defmethod edit-undo ((pane editor-pane))
   (editor-or-echo-cmd pane 'editor:undo-command))


(defmethod edit-undo-enabled ((pane editor-pane))
   (let ((buffer (editor-pane-buffer pane)))
     (or (and (editor:buffer-modified buffer) (editor:buffer-writable  
buffer))
         (echo-pane-active pane))))

D'oh!  I knew there was something I had forgotten...

Yes, that gives me the behaviour I want.

&gt (editor-or-echo-cmd pane 'editor:undo-command))

That's interesting.  There seems to be a difference between calling
PROCESS-CHARACTER with the string "Undo" (which is supposed to call
UNDO-COMMAND) or with the symbol EDITOR:UNDO-COMMAND.  If I do the
latter, it works as expected.

Thanks,
Edi.

Er, no, that was nonsense.  The real culprit was that I was too
careful[1] and wrapped the call to EDITOR:BUFFER-MODIFIED which
checked if the "Undo" menu item should be enabled with the notorious
EDITOR:PROCESS-CHARACTER.  If I call the function directly instead,
the issue goes away.  Whether the undo command is called as "Undo" or
as EDITOR:UNDO-COMMAND doesn't make a difference.

Sorry for the confusion,
Edi.
