                <pre>
Hello,

I try to learn more about multiprocessing mechanisms, and I would like to
know if I well understand some basics. Thanks by advance for your great
assistance :)

1)
If a loop iterate at some time interval and send some tasks to other
processes : Is it correct to say that, if the order of the tasks in the
different processes will be done in parallel, on the other hand all the
successive tasks (t1, t2, t3...) sent to a same process will be done
sequentially, and that t2 never will be executed before the execution of t1
is finished ?

2)
If a task is always in the mailbox queue of the process, does it means that
it is non executed (and so that it can be aborted) ? Does the process do :

pop the queue
execute the task

OR

execute the task (always in the queue)
pop the queue

?

For instance does this code do what I mean (replace a obsolete job by a new
one of the same kind) ?

(without-interrupts
  (when (eq (mp:mailbox-peek (mp:process-mailbox process1)) prev-task)
    (progn (mp:mailbox-read (mp:process-mailbox process1))
      (mp:process-send process1 new-task))))

Or, maybe more efficient :

(without-interrupts
  (when (eq (mp:mailbox-peek (mp:process-mailbox p1)) prev-task)
    (setf (cdr prev-task) (cdr new-task))) ;when the car is the same



Thanks

Denis

Hi Denis --

Your question is not easy to answer -- there are lots of issues here  
and it's hard to figure where to start.  My general advice would be  
that you do some reading about the principles of doing multiprocessing  
-- it is a notoriously difficult area and if you do not get it quite  
right you are like to experience subtle errors can be very hard indeed  
to track down.  Believe me, such subtle errors will steal your time  
and hurt your productivity so if you really want to work with multiple  
processes, understanding multiprocessing principles will be a  
worthwhile investment!

As far as Lispworks is concerned, it offers two synchronization  
mechanisms to support your multiprocessing efforts: locks and  
mailboxes, and additionally there's mp:without-preemption and  
mp:without-interrupts. Both locks and mailboxes have the potential to  
do all the synchronization needed, and they can be used in combination  
too.  The exact behaviour of the mp:without-... operators is not very  
well documented (IMHO), so I try not to rely on them -- locks and  
mailboxes are well-known from the literature, will do everything you  
need, so I believe they're a safe bet.  It is possible that  
mp:without-... are more efficient under some circumstances - I don't  
know anything about that.

The code you present above seems to 'sit on two chairs at the same  
time': You seem to be using mp:without-interrupts to gain exclusive  
access, and then you PEEK in the mailbox.  Generally, I would not  
think that is a good way to use a mailbox -- it has built-in exclusive  
access, i.e. any Lisp process can safely use it without any other  
synchronization being necessary.

To give you an idea of how you might use a mailbox consider the  
following definitions:

(defvar *job-count* 0)

(defun each-job-has-own-mailbox (fn arglist)
   (let ((mbox (make-mailbox)))
     (flet ((retrieve-result ()
              (apply #'values (mailbox-read mbox))))
       (process-run-function (format nil "JOB-~d" (incf *job-count*))
                             nil
                             (lambda (fn1 arglist1)
                               (mailbox-send mbox (multiple-value-list  
(apply fn1 arglist1))))
                             fn arglist)
       #'retrieve-result)))

Here we're assigning a mailbox to each 'job' and offer an interface  
where the user provides a function and an arglist, and gets in return  
a closure to call to retrieve the result of the 'job'.  The code above  
offers solutions as to how to know WHEN to call the closure -- it will  
be block until the result becomes available.

We might use this code like this

MP-EXAMPLE 4 &gt (flet ((job-fn (a b)
                         (- a b)))
                  (let ((joblist (loop for job in '((1 3) (10 10) (20  
10))
                                       collect (list job (each-job-has- 
own-mailbox #'job-fn job)))))
                    (loop for jdesc in joblist
                          do (format t "~&amp;JOB ~a is doing ~a." (second  
jdesc) (first jdesc)))
                    ;; collect results
                    (loop for jdesc in joblist
                          collect (list (first jdesc) (funcall (second  
jdesc))))))
JOB #&lt;Closure (EACH-JOB-HAS-OWN-MAILBOX . RETRIEVE-RESULT) 200BF4B2&gt  
is doing (1 3).
JOB #&lt;Closure (EACH-JOB-HAS-OWN-MAILBOX . RETRIEVE-RESULT) 200BF15A&gt  
is doing (10 10).
JOB #&lt;Closure (EACH-JOB-HAS-OWN-MAILBOX . RETRIEVE-RESULT) 200C0DBA&gt  
is doing (20 10).
(((1 3) -2) ((10 10) 0) ((20 10) 10))

I am just print the 'jobs' to show the exist independently of the  
results.  Using this code we use a closure to abstract the interface  
to the spawn job.  The underlying mechanism used to synchronize is the  
mailbox, but we could actually have used an MP:LOCK instead, with the  
same result.  (In fact the mailbox may been implemented using a lock,  
but that's not important at all.)

A different way to accomplish the same thing, still using mailbox, is  
to have just a single mailbox to which all results are sent.  This  
might look something like this

(defun arbiter-has-mailbox (fn joblist)
   (let* ((mbox (make-mailbox))
          (count 0))
     (loop for job in joblist
           do (process-run-function (format nil "JOB-~d" (incf *job- 
count*))
                                    nil
                                    (lambda (mbox1 fn1 arglist1)
                                      (mailbox-send mbox1 (apply fn1  
arglist1)))
                                    mbox fn job)
           do (incf count))
     (loop repeat count
           collect (mailbox-read mbox))))

which might be used like this

MP-EXAMPLE 5 &gt (arbiter-has-mailbox (lambda (a b) (- a b)) '((1 3) (10  
10) (20 10)))
(-2 10 0)

Not very elegant, perhaps, but effective.  One could probably come up  
with something more flexible.  Clearly there's the issue of know how  
many times to call MP:MAILBOX-READ on the mailbox, but we'll just  
disregard that here.

Please note that this code is just to get you started thinking and  
give you an idea of what using mailboxes might look like - it's not  
for production.

HTH.

best regards,

-Klaus.

PS Longtime readers of lisphug may know that I personally believe that  
Erlang's message-passing infrastructure addresses these issues in a  
particularly elegant and powerful way, to the extent that I have  
implemented large parts of it in cl-muproc.  -K.

Hi Klaus,

Thanks a lot for your answer : I will take my time to examine and test it.
My first impression is that you are using mailbox in these examples to deal
with messages (result of tasks) when I use it (maybe incorrectly) to
implement a pile of tasks. My questions was thought for this particular
context, so it's better if I precise a little bit.

Here is how I define my processes at launch level with one mailbox per
process : 

(defun make-background-process (process-name &amp;optional (priority 0))
  (let* ((wait-string (format nil "Waiting for tasks" process-name))
         (return-string (format nil "Return from ~d" process-name))
         (process (mp:process-run-function
                   process-name (list :priority priority)
                   #'(lambda ()
                       (with-simple-restart (abort return-string)
                         (loop do
                               (with-simple-restart (abort return-string)
                                 (let ((self mp:*current-process*))
                                   (mp:process-wait wait-string
#'mp:mailbox-peek (mp:process-mailbox self))
                                   (let ((task (mp:mailbox-read
(mp:process-mailbox self))))
                                     (apply (car task) (cdr task)))))))))))
    (setf (mp:process-mailbox process) (mp:make-mailbox))
    process))

And then to send task to processes I use this :

(defun apply-in-background-process (process priority function &amp;rest args)
  (push function args)
  (mp:process-send process args :change-priority priority))

Hi Denis --

Your code seems to work, and having seen your code, I think I  
understand your questions a little better.

Basically, when you write multiprocessing code, you should assume that  
all the processes run concurrently and that your code is responsible  
for making them behave correctly, considered all together.  In  
principle, code executing in one thread may be stopped at any time and  
another thread be resumed, except when you change that, by explicitly  
adding synchronization operations to your code. So the answer to your  
question

&gt 2)
&gt If a task is always in the mailbox queue of the process, does it  
&gt means that
&gt it is non executed (and so that it can be aborted) ? Does the  
&gt process do :
&gt
&gt pop the queue
&gt execute the task
&gt
&gt OR
&gt
&gt execute the task (always in the queue)
&gt pop the queue
&gt
&gt ?

is "It depends!" ... on how you synchronize your threads, using locks,  
mailboxs and critical sections (that's what mp:without-... give you).   
There is no magic, just synchronization code to make sure everything  
happens just right.

In current versions of Lispworks, only one Lisp thread/process  
actually execute at a time, even if you have a multi-core og multi- 
processor machine.

A few comments to the code just posted (your code, for reference)

    (defun make-background-process (process-name &amp;optional (priority 0))
      (let* ((wait-string (format nil "Waiting for tasks" process-name))
             (return-string (format nil "Return from ~d" process-name))
             (process (mp:process-run-function
                       process-name (list :priority priority)
                       #'(lambda ()
                           (with-simple-restart (abort return-string)
                             (loop do
                                   (with-simple-restart (abort return- 
string)
                                     (let ((self mp:*current-process*))
                                       (mp:process-wait wait-string
                                                        #'mp:mailbox- 
peek (mp:process-mailbox self))
                                       (let ((task (mp:mailbox-read
                                                    (mp:process- 
mailbox self))))
                                         (apply (car task) (cdr  
task)))))))))))
        (setf (mp:process-mailbox process) (mp:make-mailbox))
        process))

    (defun apply-in-background-process (process priority function  
&amp;rest args)
      (push function args)
      (mp:process-send process args :change-priority priority))

Although using PROCESS-WAIT permits you to set the thread status, I  
find using both PROCESS-WAIT in combination with MAILBOX-PEEK _and_  
MAILBOX-READ to be overly complicated - I'd certainly prefer to just  
do a straight MAILBOX-READ.  Also, I'd probably prefer to close over  
mailbox (instead using PROCESS-MAILBOX) and return a closure to post  
things to it, as in

    (defun make-background-process (process-name &amp;optional (priority 0))
      (let ((mailbox (mp:make-mailbox)))
        (flet ((worker (mbox name)
                 (with-simple-restart (abort (format nil "Abort job  
known as ~a." name))
                   (loop with proceed = (format nil "Allow ~a to  
proceed to next job." name)
                         for task = (mailbox-read mbox)
                         do (with-simple-restart (proceed proceed)
                              (apply (car task) (cdr task))))))
               (submit-job (function &amp;rest args)
                 (mp:mailbox-sed mailbox (push function args)
                 'ok)))
          (mp:process-run-function process-name (list :priority  
priority)
                                   #'worker mailbox process-name)
          #'submit-job)))

Using FLET instead of LAMBDA makes the code easier to read and also  
helps because the printer will actually tell you the lexical context  
of the closure (effectively telling you what kind it is).  The above  
code yields this

   MP-EXAMPLE 1 &gt (defparameter *mylist* nil)
   *MYLIST*

   MP-EXAMPLE 2 &gt (let ((submit (make-background-process "WORKER-1")))
                   (funcall submit (lambda (x) (push x *mylist*)) 42))
   OK

   MP-EXAMPLE 3 &gt *mylist*
   (42)

   MP-EXAMPLE 4 &gt

Much of this is a matter of taste, of course.  The above code does not  
set the process status while waiting for a task, so that's a weakness  
compared to yours.

HTH.

best regards,

-Klaus.

Hi Klaus,

About the process status, I am a little bit afraid : does not this loop,
with any wait-process call, completely overflow the system ?

For the other modifications you propose, I agree : I made this mix between
my codes and your proposals and, effectively, the codes are clearer (and
avoid the call to mp:*current-process* witch was not very convincing).
Thanks for your help !

(defun make-background-process (process-name &amp;optional (priority 0))
  (let ((mailbox (mp:make-mailbox)) process)
    (flet ((worker (mbox name)
             (with-simple-restart (abort (format nil "Abort job known as
~a." name))
               (loop do (with-simple-restart (abort (format nil "Allow ~a to
proceed to next job." name))
                          (mp:process-wait (format nil "Waiting for tasks"
name) #'mp:mailbox-peek mbox)
                          (let ((task (mp:mailbox-read mbox)))
                            (apply (car task) (cdr task))))))))
      (setf process (mp:process-run-function process-name (list :priority
priority) #'worker mailbox process-name)
            (mp:process-mailbox process) mailbox)
      process)))

Best Regards

Denis

Ah! - we're getting somewhere (this explains, at least to me, your use  
of MP:PROCESS-WAIT): No, MP:MAILBOX-READ blocks until a message can be  
read.  Check the reference manual for MAILBOX-READ - http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw50/LWRM/html/lwref-382.htm#pgfId-938979 
, second paragraph in Description.  (Side effect: I learned that you  
can specify a wait-reason in calls to MAILBOX-READ - forgot about that.)

best regards,

-Klaus.

Ah well ! I understand my mistake. So this is better (removing the useless
process-wait and mailbox-peek calls) :

(defun make-background-process (process-name &amp;optional (priority 0))
  (let ((mailbox (mp:make-mailbox)) process)
    (flet ((worker (mbox name)
             (with-simple-restart (abort (format nil "Abort job known as
~a." name))
               (loop for task = (mp:mailbox-read mbox)
                     do (with-simple-restart (abort (format nil "Allow ~a to
proceed to next job." name))
                          (apply (car task) (cdr task)))))))
      (setf process (mp:process-run-function process-name (list :priority
priority) #'worker mailbox process-name)
            (mp:process-mailbox process) mailbox)
      process)))

Thanks !
