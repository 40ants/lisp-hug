                <h1>playing quicktime movies in a row</h1>
                <pre>
Hi all,

I am using the Lispworks CAPI and OBJC packages to open and play  
Quicktime movies on MacOsx. I use the example code of the Lispworks  
5.1. enterprise edition for Macintosh that can be found under "/ 
Library/lib/5-1-0-0/examples/objc/movie-view.lisp" for opening and  
playing the movies. I changed all the NSMovie and NSMovieView classes  
to the current QTMovie QTMovieView classes as specified in the  
Quicktime Developers documentation.

My problem is that I need to play several movies in a row in the same  
pane. However, the next movie already starts playing before the first  
one stops. The next movie should therefore wait until the first one  
stops playing, but I can't find a way to do this.

I already tried the objc-methods "isPlaying" (in the original code  
using NSMovie) and "rate" (corresponding method for QTMovie), which  
returns a boolean. Unfortunately, these methods return "1" even if the  
movie has reached its end. In other words: it does not stop playing.  
For the QTMovie class, I then tried getting the "duration" and  
"currentTime" of the movies, but I don't succeed in writing the right  
interface between Lisp and objc.

Can anyone help me?

Many thanks,

Remi
