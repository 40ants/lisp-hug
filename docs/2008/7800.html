In my version of progress-dialog packed within ywidgets and based on Michal
Krupka's code, I am running heavy computation in the process of the progress
popup window itself. I have basically tested this with the simplest progress
function only updating the popup's meter. IIRC, updating the caller window
also worked.

My approach to this is to run the operation in a separate faceless  
process which calls back to the interface with progress information.  
The interface switches to a progress display with a cancel button that  
can be used to kill the computation process.

This works for me on both Mac and Windows.

Yes, that's what I'm also doing in my example code (see the
:SEPARATE-THREAD keyword).  Except that I don't want to
MP:PROCESS-KILL the background process at some random point.  That
seems too big a hammer for my taste.

My impression is that this only works reliably if the background
procress isn't able to saturate the CPU (core) for a longer period.
Or if there are enough places in the background process where LW
releases the "big lock".

In this kind of situation I force the computation to slow down with some
calls to process-wait-with-time-out (rather than process-allow-scheduling).
This let a chance to the display operations to run.
The problem is to find the good delay. Here, with a delay of one millisecond
it's run on my intel Mac :

(defun test-in-separate-threads ()
  (let* ((update-callback
          (lambda (iteration text)
            (mp:process-wait-with-timeout nil 0.001)
            (update-output-pane text)
            (update-progress-pane iteration)))
         (start-function
          (lambda ()
            (mp:process-run-function "worker" nil
                                     (lambda ()
                                       (work update-callback))))))
    (setq *test-interface*
          (make-instance 'test-interface :button-args `(:callback
,start-function)))
    (capi:display *test-interface*)))

Naturally it's probably not the faster way...

&gt 
&gt I have an application with a somewhat complicated GUI from which you
&gt can start a heavy computation.  What I want is that the intermediate
&gt results of the computation are reported in the main interface while a
&gt little window pops up which shows the overall progress and also
&gt provides a button to stop the computation.  The attached code is a
&gt gross simplification of the actual situation, but it should hopefully
&gt be enough to illustrate my problem.
&gt 
&gt My first approach was to just do it in a straightforward way.  Update
&gt the GUI whenever there's a reason to update it.  That's what you get
&gt if you run (TEST).  If you do that, the progress window is updated,
&gt but the "main" window is kind of dead - try to move the progress
&gt window around and you'll note that the main window isn't repainted.
&gt 
&gt Not good.  So I thought that this happened because the heavy
&gt computation runs in the thread of the main window and prevents it from
&gt taking care of windoing events.  The next thing I tried was equivalent
&gt to (TEST :SEPARATE-THREAD T).  If I try this, everything locks up, no
&gt progress is reported at all.  If you're lucky, you can find the
&gt "worker" process in the Process Browser and kill it.
&gt 
&gt Hmmm.  I tend to think that this wouldn't happen (see previous
&gt discussions), if we had real SMP.  Anyway, I tried a third solution.
&gt That'd be (TEST :WAIT T).  In this case, the computation thread
&gt actually waits until the progress window has been updated.  This
&gt doesn't seem like an ideal solution to me as it kind of serializes the
&gt events and takes all the fun out of multi-threading, but at least it
&gt works.  More or less, that is, as the whole computation now has to
&gt halt when you move the progress window around and only continues once
&gt you stop moving it... :(
&gt 
&gt Am I missing a solution that's substantially better?  Why do I only
&gt have to wait for the progress window and not for the main window?  Why
&gt do (TEST :WAIT T :SEPARATE-THREAD T) and (TEST :WAIT T) behave the
&gt same?
&gt 
&gt BTW, all this might be specific to Windows as each top-level interface
&gt has its own thread there.

Is there a ready-made way to unit test the windowed output of functions 
(for Windows)?

I have scanned the unit test libraries here 
(http://www.cl-user.net/asp/BK9t6/sdataQIrH-xEyOeShDQjr-br2cQTk8yBX8yBX8oQ5Ss9v-ujg$Np5/sdataQu3F$sSHnB==) 
and have started using lisp-unit, but that doesn't have anything along 
those lines.

As the earlier poster said, if you want to do automated testing of a
GUI you'll need some sort of record and replay software.  As far as I
know there is no good software where you can write gui tests in Common
Lisp as you would for "normal" unit tests.

I've used http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_QuickTest_Professional in a
previous project for this purpose.  That was a web-based app in Scheme
(about 75k loc if I remember right), but it's the same idea for any
gui.

Cheers,
Chris Dean

P.S. If you ever switch to a web-based app, there are now some
     JavaScript based testing frameworks available.
