                <pre>
As an advanced beginner I recall very well the difficulties to set up  
the first working Lisp environment.

One step is the installation of ASDF. Not very complicated, but not  
necessary when using SBCL. There
you simply say (require 'asdf) and your done.

Is there any chance to include this into LW too? What do others think  
about this?

I think it's a great idea - in fact, anything that makes Lisp or  
LispWorks more user-friendly.

Beyond that, I'll hold my tongue and let the "real" programmers weigh  
in.

....and I'd also vote for including Edi's lw-add-ons by default. ;)

But this may be risky, because the LispWorkers would have to maintain  
the integration of code they don't control...

I think that's a good idea.

To clarify one thing first - this is, as Jens also said, mainly for
our beloved "newbies".  I've been following comp.lang.lisp and lots of
Lisp mailing lists over the last nine years or so and I think it's
hard to deny that, like it or not, a) ASDF is the de-facto standard
for open source Lisp libraries nowadays, and b) people new to Lisp
usually seem to have a hard time setting up an environment where they
can quickly load and try some of these libraries.

If a Lisp implementation comes with ASDF out of the box, that's at
least one potential stumbling block that's out of the way.  SBCL
always had ASDF integrated (that's where it came from), and today at
least OpenMCL, ECL, and, cough, AllegroCL also have it.  The license
certainly can't be a problem - otherwise Franz' lawyers wouldn't have
agreed to distribute it with their product... :)

So, I think it would be in LispWorks' own long-term interest to bundle
ASDF as well.  It will probably, hopefully help to make LispWorks more
attractive for people who come to CL for the first time.

I, personally, don't care that much.  Like almost everyone else on
this mailing list, I already know how where to get and how to load a
library if I need it, but I'm not a member of the target group.

So, yeah, you have my vote... :)

Edi.

I don't think that's a good idea.  It is still in flux, there are
competing versions, it depends on external applications like tar and
GPG, and it is more or less useless on Windows.

Jens,
I would be very surprised if they do so, given that LW already has a  
defsystem utility.

It's one more hurdle for the newbie to pass before it has a working
environment.  This is a proposed cuddle-the-newbies feature, AIUI, not
for a seasoned user like yourself.  If you already know how to find
and load mk:defsystem or asdf, you're not in the target group.

&gt (or, why not?, for those of us who stick to it) MK:DEFSYSTEM,

The why not is that like it or not, ASDF is the system definition tool
of choice for most of the librarise on common-lisp.net.  As long as
the goal is to lower the barrier to entry, providing MK:DEFSYSTEM
doesn't really help as much as providing ASDF.

I think the point was to allow them to use all the fancy libraries
without having to make any sense out of systems and stuff.

I'm not convinced that including ASDF in Lispworks will make the
hordes turn to lisp(-works), but I can't see the harm either.

I haven't had any problems with ASDF on Windows so far.  ASDF-INSTALL
is a mess on Windows, yes, ASDF not as far as I can tell.  I'm using
it every day and Windows is my main platform.

Or why not support Franz' project definition files?  My estimate is
that from the 300+ projects hosted on common-lisp.net probably 0
(zero) use MK:DEFSYSTEM.  That's the relevant difference between it
and ASDF.

That's another good point, BTW.  Several people said that it's not so
hard to put the line (load "asdf") in your ~/.lispworks file.  That's
true, but it doesn't really help you if your ~/.lispworks file isn't
loaded... :)

As, again, this is mostly about "newbies", one can assume that almost
all of them will start with the Personal Edition.

OK, but it's the same order of magnitude as zero... :)

FWIW, there are at least three projects on common-lisp.net maintained
by Kenny Tilton, so I think there are at least three projects there
which come with AllegroCL .lpr files... :)

That has all been done already, FWIW.  Source code can be found here:
