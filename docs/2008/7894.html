Hello,

Could you answer to the below question ? (posted on the mailing list on 19 March).

Best regards,

Francis

Hello,

It seems that the value of array-total-size-limit constant is actualy the value of ARRAY-DIMENSION-LIMIT (see below). If it's a bug, is there a patch for this? (want array-total-size-limit to really be 536870911).

Can someone tell me the value of ARRAY-TOTAL-SIZE-LIMIT for 64-bit LWw?

Thank you,

Francis

                 (dim1 (* 1000 1000))

            (format t "~&amp; ~d ~d ~a" total-size array-total-size-limit (&lt; total-size array-total-size-limit))

It is not uncommon for these two to be the same in lisp  
implementations - after all, in one dimensional arrays they are the  
same thing.

You may be interrested in the answer I have received from LW:

You are correct, ARRAY-TOTAL-SIZE-LIMIT is set to the wrong value in LispWorks
5.0.  This will be fixed in LispWorks 5.1.

The correct value is 67108337 in 32-bit LispWorks.  However, the definition of
this constant is rather confusing, because it refers to the largest array of
any element type.  In the case of element-type T, you can actually make an
array with up to 134216673 elements in 32-bit LispWorks.

The maximum number of element in an array with element-type T in 64-bit
LispWorks is 536870910.
