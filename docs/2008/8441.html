                <h1>LispWorks and code compatibility</h1>
                <pre>
I'm thinking about becoming more serious with developing Common
Lisp applications using LispWorks but I want to know first how
compatible is code developed using LIspWorks with regards to other
implementions.

I'm using LispWorks on FreeBSD and I want to know how compatible
is the code that I will write across LispWorks versions. Do I need to
modify the code to make it compile on LispWorks for Linux (or
Windows)? Will it work out of the box?

Depends which features you use: are you using non-standard Common
Lisp? (ie the Windowing API?) Then you're out of luck. However,
standard Common Lisp should work with only minor modifications on
other implementations. Usually this means your algorithms are
portable, but the UI may not.

I have no experience there, but I hear it should.

It's generally very compatible. Even GUI code (written with CAPI)
needs very few #+-es to work. I grepped through 37k lines of my GUI
code, and the only thing I found was some fine-tuning of sizes
of fonts and gui elements, and different path name defaults for
different OSes.

Oops. Sorry. I should have said "LispWorks implementations" instead of
just "implementations".

Yes. The compatibility question is confined to LispWorks with other
OSes.

&gt
&gt Common Lisp code is compatible across LispWorks implementations. We
&gt aim to make extensions compatible as far as possible, and document any
&gt discrepancies.
&gt
&gt Almost all code that works in LispWorks for FreeBSD will work in
&gt LispWorks for Linux. One area of discrepancies is code that uses third
&gt party libraries which may or be not be present on the other OS.
&gt
&gt Most code that works in LispWorks for FreeBSD will also work in
&gt LispWorks for Windows. The areas with discrepancies include the system
&gt interfaces (SYS:CALL-SYSTEM, SYS:OPEN-PIPE, etc) and foreign functions
&gt (pay attention to the calling convention).
&gt
&gt You are in a good position with the GUI in LispWorks because CAPI code
&gt is highly portable between its three supported GUI libraries, though
&gt of course there are always a few features that a particular platform
&gt cannot support. We aim to document such discrepancies. (If you find a
&gt discrepancy that is not documented, please report that directly to
&gt lisp-support@lispworks.com as a bug.)
&gt
&gt The LispWorks IDE is written with CAPI and illustrates much of what
&gt can be done portably.

That's good to know. Are these "discrepancies" documented

OK, but is there a central set of documents that describes which parts of the

that lists all these discrepancies so that I'll know in advance what
to watch out
for and for me to be more aware?

Some time ago (LW 4.2 era) I wrote a fairly substantial application  
(ended up I think between 20 &amp; 30 kloc) which needed to run on Linux.   
I didn't have a Linux machine for the first month or so, so wrote it  
on LWW.  When I did finally get access to a Linux machine, I checked  
out the code, compiled and ran it.  There were no code changes needed.

The application itself did not have a GUI, but there were GUI tools  
around it (things to look a data structures &amp;c), which also worked out  
of the box.

I can confirm that.  As long as you don't use OS-specific things like,
say, MDI interfaces on Windows, the only area where you /could/ run
into compatibility problems with GUI apps is the relation between
threads and GUI elements (specifically editor panes) on OS X vs. other
platforms.  If you're aware of this and code "defensively", so to say,
you should be fine.

Very good point, Edi. Shame on me for forgetting to mention that.
The limitation on OS X is that all GUI operations run in a single thread,
which means that "execute-with-interface" will not run in a different
thread if it's called from one interface with a different interface
as a parameter.

To the LispWorks guys: Any plans on changing that in a future release?
It has given me a few headaches every now and then.

To be more precise than Chun Tuan was, it is possible to run GUI  
elements in separate threads (I do so in Clozure CL for example).  
However, the AppKit itself is not thread safe so any call in any  
thread that causes a GUI element to be modified (i.e., redrawn) needs  
to happen on the main thread. The AppKit provides  
performSelector:onMainThread:withObject:waitUntilDone: (and others)  
for this purpose.

So yes, you can have GUI code on more than one thread, but then you  
have to be careful to always call visible GUI element modifications on  
the main thread. For example, you can allocate and initialize GUI  
elements on a separate thread, but when you show them, you must do it  
on the main thread.
