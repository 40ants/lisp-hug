                <pre>
Does LispWorks 5.1 have a split editor window capability? If so, where
do I find it?


Ctrl-x 2  just seems to open a duplicate of the same window.  I've
tried and tried to use the two windows simultaneously, but that's just
frustrating. Clicking or typing in one may change the view of another.
Choose a definition from the definitions list may effect the other
window, not the current one, etc.

I'm tempted to go back to Emacs, but I'm heavily using the call tree,
debug, class and generic function browsers and I don't want to give them up.

I miss this feature, too.  I asked this question a few years ago and got the 
answer "no".

But (!), now that you mention it, there is nothing preventing you (or someone) 
from defining an interface with more than one visible editor pane.

Very briefly, something like this:

(in-package "COMMON-LISP-USER")

(capi:define-interface split-edit ()
  ()
  (:panes
   (editor-pane-1
    capi:editor-pane)
   (editor-pane-2
    capi:editor-pane)
   (echo-area-pane-1
    capi:echo-area-pane
    :external-max-height '(:character 1)))
  (:layouts
   (column-layout-1
    capi:column-layout
    '(editor-pane-1 editor-pane-2 echo-area-pane-1)))
  (:default-initargs
   :best-height 501
   :best-width 424
   :layout 'column-layout-1
   :title "Interface-1"))

(defun sedit ()
  (capi:display (make-instance 'split-edit)))



Obviously, new editor key-bindings would need to be made to navigate this 
interface, change buffers and make it more emacs-multi-pane-like.  (I suspect 
that if one read through the editor source or asked nicely, it might even be 
possible to "integrate" such buffers with the other tools in the ide).

Actually, LispWorks /does/ have this feature. Try out: C-x 5, and C-x
6. C-x 5 does a horizontal split (two side by side panes) and C-x 6
does a vertical split (two stacked panes).

M-x Describe Bindings gives a list of keybindings, and the following
is taken from that:

Ctrl-x 0            Delete Window
Ctrl-x 1            Delete Other Windows
Ctrl-x 2            New Window
Ctrl-x 4 b          Select Buffer Other Window
Ctrl-x 5            Split Window Horizontally
Ctrl-x 6            Split Window vertically
Ctrl-x 7            Unsplit Window

I wondered the same thing when made my discovery. I only stumbled upon
it by (mistakenly) trying to use some of the Emacs frame commands in
the LW editor.

&gt Cool.  I wonder when that was introduced?  I've been suffering needlessly.
