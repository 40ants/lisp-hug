                <h1>Delivered application performance decrease</h1>
                <pre>
Hi everyone,

I just started playing with Lispworks Application Builder and the  
Delivery process. I have started with a small test application that  
does nothing besides reading a huge log file and creating/storing in  
memory a specific CLOS instance for each log entry in the file.

When i tried this test application from within the Lispworks IDE i was  
pretty happy, parsing my 50Mb log file with almost 310,000 entry lines  
in 10-12 seconds didn't seem bad for the purpose of what i was doing.

But when i tried from the delivered application i got to some really  
crappy 50-60 seconds while parsing the exact same time. I could live  
with a small performance decrease, but 5x worse seems like too much.

Is there any particular way i could profile my delivered application  
and see where the problem might reside? Is this some kind of known  
issue?

Thank you in advance for any help,


Alexandre Paes

Hello!

The most likely reason for this (BTDT) is that you've set up your
delivery script in the wrong way: I bet it loads uncompiled code!
