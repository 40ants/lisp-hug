                <h1>LispWors editor hanging</h1>
                <pre>
There was a thread back in June about the LispWorks editor hanging 
(titled "Editor hanging bug?") but there was no resolution.

I'm using LispWorks 5.1.1 on an IntelMac with Leopard, and have been 
daily since its release. But suddenly yesterday and today the editor is 
giving me a lot of trouble, it's become  unusable. Any time I open a 
string with a double quote and then move the cursor, or sometimes just 
type, LispWorks freezes and its processor usage flies to 99%.  I've 
tried waiting and waiting, and it never finishes. 

Now, when editing, I have to save my code constantly. I've had to Force 
Quit and relaunch LW half a dozen times already today and I've pretty 
much had it.

I tried changing some of the editor preferences, switching between Emac 
and Mac OS X mode. But no luck.  Is there some preference I can reset?

I filed a bug report and learned from Martin Simmons that "The loop
[in which the editor is stuck[ is actually in the code that detects
definitions in the buffer, so is unrelated to syntax highlighting." (I
assume that bug report threads aren't confidential.) I feel your pain
though; I've adapted my editing style to this bug (always starting
strings by typing "" and then typing in between, &amp;c.), but I still
have days where I end up locking the editor five times in half an
hour. That's when I usually take an early lunch. ^_^

I was told that it will be fixed though, so hopefully some upcoming
patch will take care of it...
