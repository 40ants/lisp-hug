                <h1>Centering output-pane text</h1>
                <pre>
I'm using gp:draw-string to display text in an output-pane. I'd like  
to center it horizontally (or perhaps right-justify). In order to do  
that, it would be great if there were a function that returns the  
width of the string in pixels.

Question #1: Is there such a function?

I happen to be using a fixed-width font, which means I could  
presumably do a simple computation based on the number of characters,  
but I'd like a more general solution.

For some of my panes (this is a calendar with days that respond to  
clicks and weekly totals that don't), I could use something other than  
an output-pane, but even then I don't see what kind of pane provides  
for centered text.

Question #2: Are there panes that provide for displaying centered text?

Thanks! (LWM 5.1.1)

I found an old post with a response by Arthur Lemmens:

I don't think so.
    Or must this only be done manually? For example, calculating the
    pixel width of the string and shift x accordingly.
Yes, that's how I did it when I needed this.
    If so, is there a  method for calculating the pixel width automatically?
GP:GET-STRING-EXTENT.
I attach some code that I wrote as part of my own chart-drawing library.
Please feel free to use this code.

and here's an example of its use:

CL-USER 1 &gt (defvar pane (make-instance 'capi:output-pane))
PANE

CL-USER 2 &gt (capi:contain pane)
#&lt;CAPI:OUTPUT-PANE  214A5A8F&gt

CL-USER 3 &gt (gp:get-string-extent pane "Hello World!")

CL-USER 4 &gt (gp:get-string-extent pane "Hello")
0
-11
30

That search cartouche is for entering terms for the Mac OS X Help  
Viewer. If an application does not provide Mac OS X Help Viewer help  
files (usually at MyApp.app/Contents/Resources/Language.lproj/ 
MyAppHelp/) then searching using that cartouche won't find anything.  
LispWorks doesn't provide such help files, but rather has its own help  
system and manuals.
