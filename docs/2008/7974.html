                <h1>SLIME, LispWorks and UTF-8 revisited</h1>
                <pre>
It seems that this problem was discussed before 
(http://article.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.lispworks.general/5559)

and this problem had bitten me on day one with Lispworks. Short 
description: start SLIME with

:coding-system "utf-8-unix", type at the SLIME REPL something like 
(code-char 3000) and get "Lisp

connection terminated". Seems that comm:socket-stream is not working 
with external formats, so

slime-lispworks just ignores it.


The solution involving using flexi-streams in the article mentioned 
above probably wouldn't be acceptable

for SLIME (it also for some reason didn't work for me on the first try, 
but I didn't investigate further), so

I thought that something lightweight might do the trick. This is the 
first time I'm seeing LW's user-defined

streams and not everything is clear from the documentation, so I'd very 
much like people with more

experience in this area to have look and tell me if I'm doing something 
stupid.


The idea is to subclass the comm:socket-stream and provide 
external-format processing on just the methods

that are used by SLIME. At the moment it seems to work (checked only 
with the utf-8 encoding) both with

and without swank:*use-dedicated-output-stream*.


I do not post this in patch format since it's mostly a request for 
comments at the moment and the change is

located in one place only. In file swank-lispworks.lisp the function 
accept-connection is replaced by the following

code:


(defclass ef-socket-stream (comm:socket-stream)
  ((ext-format :reader ext-format :initarg :ext-format)))


;; This seems to greatly affect which generic stream functions

;; are called by the standard ones in CL:

;; (defmethod stream-element-type ((stream ef-socket-stream))
;;   ;;'lw:simple-char
;;   'character
;;   )


(defun decode-external-string-or-nil (buffer external-format &amp;key (start 
0) end)
  (handler-bind ((arithmetic-error #'(lambda (condition)
                                       (declare (ignore condition))
                                       (return-from 
decode-external-string-or-nil nil) )))
    (ef:decode-external-string buffer external-format
                               :start start :end end)))


(defmethod stream:stream-read-sequence ((stream ef-socket-stream) 
sequence start end)
  (setf end (or end (length sequence)))
  (setf start (or start 0))

  (let* ((charlen-to-read (- end start))
         (buf (make-array (list (* 4 charlen-to-read))
                          :element-type '(unsigned-byte 8)))
         (pos (call-next-method stream buf 0 end)))

    (loop for decoded = (decode-external-string-or-nil buf (ext-format 
stream)
                                                       :start 0 :end pos)
       until (and decoded
                  (= (length decoded) charlen-to-read))
       do
         (setf (aref buf pos) (stream:stream-read-byte stream))
         (incf pos)
       finally
         (replace sequence decoded :start1 start :end1 end)
         (return end))))


(defmethod stream:stream-write-char ((stream ef-socket-stream) char)
  (write-sequence (ef:encode-lisp-string (string char)
                                         (ext-format stream))
                  stream))


(defmethod stream:stream-write-string ((stream ef-socket-stream) string
                                       &amp;optional start end)
  (write-sequence
    (ef:encode-lisp-string string (ext-format stream)
                           :start start :end  end)
    stream))

(defmethod stream-external-format ((stream ef-socket-stream))
  (ext-format stream))


(defimplementation accept-connection (socket
                                      &amp;key external-format buffering 
timeout)
  (declare (ignore buffering timeout))
  (let* ((fd (comm::get-fd-from-socket socket)))
    (assert (/= fd -1))
    (make-instance 'ef-socket-stream :socket fd :direction :io
                   :element-type
                   ;;'base-char
                   '(unsigned-byte 8)
                   ;;'simple-char
                   :ext-format external-format)))

These changes should probably be protected by #+lispworks5 - when were 
the user-defined streams introduced?

Of course it was only meant to be just enough to get SLIME working but 
it's still interesting to know what's missing,

what should be done differently, starting with which LW version this is 
supposed to work at all, maybe other comments.
