                <h1>FLI performance</h1>I&#39;m curious as to the general overhead of a foreign function call. Currently, I have a program that is making - on average - about 50,000 FLI function calls every iteration of a tight loop. I&#39;ve written the exact same program in C++ just for a simple comparison, and profiled the Lisp program to make sure I&#39;m not doing something else bad.<br /><br />In the C++ code, I can make the 50,000 DLL function calls in ~40 milliseconds. Considering what the function does internally, this is quite good. On the Lisp side, the same 50,000 calls take ~200 milliseconds. Now, while I expected there to be some overhead with the foreign call (type checking, setting up the stack, etc), I didn&#39;t expect it to be 5x that of comparable C++ code.<br /><br />So, my question: are there any declarations I can do to increase this performance (turn off the type checking, making the foreign code __stdcall instead of __cdecl)? Also, another solution I have to the problem - since I have access to the DLL source - is to create a batch function that let&#39;s me accumulate all my data into a large buffer and then make the function call only once. But, before continue on this path, I&#39;d like to make sure that a magical declare won&#39;t fix the problem for me, and that filling out the data in the buffer won&#39;t be equally (or more) slow than the foreign call.<br /><br />Thanks for any help!<br /><br />Jeff M.

Just as a follow-up. Creating a batch function and making a foreign buffer that 
holds all the data sped the code to being only 2x instead of 5x. Much improved, 
but using the foreign buffer is a bit of a pain. It'd be much nicer if there 
was a way to improve the foreign call performance. ;-)

Another side question, while I was creating a batching structure, I came across 
define-foreign-pointer. I'm trying to understand what this is for and if it's 
can help simplify my code. For example, let's say this is my foreign buffer for 
batching:


(define-c-struct point3 (x :float) (y :float) (z :float))

(defun make-batch-buffer (size)
  (allocate-foreign-object :type `(:c-array point3 ,size)))


Trying to access members of any one of those point structures is a real 
frustration. I can't use the obvious foreign-aref or a simple dereference 
because I'm dealing with an aggregate type. So, getting an element in there is 
something like:


(foreign-slot-value 
 (dereference (foreign-array-pointer buf index) :copy-foreign-object nil)
 'x)


I was looking at define-foreign-pointer as a possible to this, since it allows 
defining slots in the structure. But I can't find any examples of where this is 
useful or how they are used. Does anyone have any?

Thanks!

Jeff M.
