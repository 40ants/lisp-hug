                <h1>how to kill an editor buffer after the interface using it goes away?</h1>
                <pre>
In examples/capi/editor/editor-pane.lisp, it creates an interface that
uses an editor-pane.  When you close the interface, the buffer sticks
around in the buffer list.  How do you kill the buffer (from within
the code)?  This is what I've tried, and it doesn't work:

(capi:define-interface editor-pane-test ()
  ()
  (:panes
   (editor-pane
    capi:editor-pane
    :text *editor-text*
    :echo-area-pane echo-area
    :visible-min-width '(character 80)
    :visible-min-height '(character 15)
    :reader editor-pane-of)
   (buttons
    capi:push-button-panel
    :items '("Beginning Of Buffer" "End Of Buffer" "Kill Line" "Undo")
    :callback-type :data
    :selection-callback #'(lambda (command)
                            (capi:call-editor editor-pane command)))
   (echo-area capi:echo-area-pane :max-height t))
  (:default-initargs
   :title "Editor Pane Test"))

(defun test-editor-pane ()
  (capi:display
   (make-instance 'editor-pane-test
                  :destroy-callback (lambda (interface)
                                      (capi:apply-in-pane-process
                                       interface
                                       (lambda ()
                                         (capi:call-editor (editor-pane-of interface)
                                                           "Kill Buffer")))))))

As near as I can tell you can put anything at all in place of "Kill
Buffer" -- I tried "Kill Bill Part 2" and it ran without error, though
obviously still didn't kill the buffer.

I don't read assembler that well, but I *think* that call-editor
returns immediately if a pane is inactive, and doesn't look at its
second argument.

.... So I'd written this much and I poked at it some more, and it turns
out that calling editor:kill-buffer-command directly appears to work:

(defun test-editor-pane ()
  (capi:display
   (make-instance 'editor-pane-test
                  :destroy-callback (lambda (interface)
                                      (capi:apply-in-pane-process
                                       interface
                                       (lambda ()
                                         (editor:kill-buffer-command
                                          t
                                          (editor:buffer-name
                                           (capi:editor-pane-buffer
                                            (editor-pane-of interface))))))))))

However, I'm concerned that perhaps something is amiss with the editor
context -- current buffer, current this-that-the-other.

Can anyone comment on either call-editor not working, or on whether
calling kill-buffer-command directly is safe?

(I also note in passing that the documented function
editor:buffers-name does not appear in my image, but
editor:buffer-name does, and returns a buffer's name.)

I noticed the same thing. I think this should qualify as a bug, I don't 
see any good reason why the editor pane buffer shows up in the file 
editor buffer list in the first place. I see some system tools use 
editor panes, and their buffers don't show up in the buffer list. I 
think the same should be true for editor-pane instances.

When I try your code in LWM 5.1.1 I actually get an error:

NIL is not of type EDITOR::WINDOW when accessing slot EDITOR::TEXT-PANE.

Which makes me think the destroy-callback is called too late, at a time 
when the editor cannot process commands anymore because its window is 
already destroyed.

What I did and it seemed to work was to just remove the buffer from the 
editor:*buffer-list* variable.
