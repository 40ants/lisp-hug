                <h1>Meaning of locked by a dead stack or unrecognized lock</h1>
                <pre>

Does anyone know what could cause an error like this:

  Trying to lock #&lt;MP:LOCK "file-store-lock" Locked once by
  "hunchentoot-worker-149932" 4100018B0B&gt : Waiting for a lock that is
  locked by a dead stack or unrecognized lock 149914

What I'm doing is reading some data from the middle of a 19GB file.
Like this pseudo-code:

  (mp:with-lock (fs-lock)
    (with-timeout (*timeout*)
      (file-position fs-stream offset)
      (read-sequence buf fs-stream)))

This code is called from multiple threads on 64bit Linux LispWorks
5.1.  *timeout* is 10 and with-timeout is a macro that uses a timer to
call mp:process-interrupt after *timeout* seconds.

I would think that mp:with-lock would guarantee that the lock would be
cleared and I wouldn't see this error.

Cheers,
Chris Dean

&gt; Are you using with-timeout in any other way? &nbsp;It probably won't
go wrong<br>
&gt; inside mp:with-lock like that, but the implementation using<br>
&gt; mp:process-interrupt to create an asynchronous throw is inherently

&gt; if it occurs in running code (rather than while sleeping) because

<br><tt><font size=2>Is there a recommended way to establish a watchdog

&gt Is it a transient problem or is the lock still locked after you get into the
&gt debugger?  

When I see this error, the error is logged and the thread is deleted.
The thread holding the lock eventually lets go of the lock and work
continues.

&gt Does the process "hunchentoot-worker-149932" (or whatever printing
&gt the lock object show) still exist at that point?

Yes the 149932 thread still exists.  Most of the time, the app will
create another thread and try again -- that is usually successfull.

Sometimes (rarely), I never get out of this state and the app wedges.
When the app wedges, the thread that is holding the lock never exits
and I am unable to mp:process-kill it or attach to it in the debugger.

Good to know, thanks.  I'm using it one other place, but only after
that mp:with-lock returns (that is, in another function called later).
