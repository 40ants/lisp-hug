CAPI's display panes by default have a right-click popup menu with the
usual Cut/Copy/Paste functionality.  So, at least internally, the CAPI
must be able to get at the current text selection of the pane.  Is
anybody aware how user code could do the same?  I poked around a bit
with the Class Browser, APROPOS, TRACE, and so on, but I haven't found
anything promising yet.

Thanks,
Edi.

Data point: on Linux I see no right-click popup menu by default on a
display-pane.  However I can highlight and then paste the highlighted
text into a terminal window, so X knows about the selection.  I was
also able to retrieve it via capi:selection, but not capi:clipboard,
which returned some other value.

Ah, OK, thanks for the info.  Would have been nice, though... :)
