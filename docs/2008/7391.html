                <h1>Groupbox availability for CAPI</h1>
                <pre>
I'd like to write a GUI application in Lispworks. For the dialog
boxes, I'd very much like to have a grouping visual like the Windows
GroupBox control. I can't find any evidence that CAPI supports this.

Does CAPI support the native Windows GroupBox or a similiar visual for
grouping related UI items?

Thanks!

Kevin

Docking layouts have a :DIVIDER-P initarg that I think does what you
want.

For the layout delineating your dialog boxes, you can specify the initarg
  :visible-border :recessed.

Ah, right, of course!  I've even used that one in some of my own apps.
So many initargs, so many things you can forget... :(

                 <h1>Callback for pinboard object outside of pinboard boundary?</h1>
                 <pre>
Is there a way for my pinboard-layout to become aware that one of its
pinboard-objects has been dragged outside the layout's visible
boundaries?  I would like to do this without explicit action by the
pinboard object.
