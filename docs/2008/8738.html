                <h1>Any clue about LispWorks freezes on OS X 10.5.5 and LW Pro 5.1.1 Intel?</h1>
                <pre>
Hello,

Occasionally, I see new Terminal window pop up, with title like
"LWtemp.gauss.loc" (where gauss is my laptop name) and contents like
this:

Last login: Wed Oct 29 19:04:26 on ttys001
/tmp/LWtemp.gauss.local.47813.1.command ; exit;
gauss:~ mikko$ /tmp/LWtemp.gauss.local.47813.1.command ; exit;

Then LispWorks freezes completely. (Beach ball starts making rounds,
and it needs Force Quit)

I have seen this in few situations. Sometimes when trying to load
non-existing library (at least on previous versions), and now I can
reproduce it consistently in my CAPI GUI program (5.1.1 Pro).

I am confident there is a bug somewhere in my code, and it may be
related to Cells I am driving my GUI with. But it would help to
understand what LW is trying to do in this situation.

Does somebody know what are these windows are about?

Best regards,

Mikko Ahonen

You can usually still interact with lispworks from these terminal  
windows (get a backtrace, restarts, etc.) I usually look at the  
backtrace to see where I've screwed up and then choose the abort  
restart which just sends me back into the lispworks ide.

regards,

Ralph

A-ha! So it is the REPL Inspector!

It would probably have been very helpful if there would have been the
command prompt on the first line...

Thanks for your help.

Best regards,

Mikko Ahonen

&gt
&gt You can also start LW from the shell, something like:
&gt
&gt .../LispWorks.app/Contents/MacOS/lispworks-5-1-0-macos-universal
&gt
&gt This sometimes tells you a lot. In previous versions of LW it was the only
&gt way to find out about certain problems.
