Hi

I am trying to figure out the status of CLtL2 Environment functions in  
LW 5.x.
My question is whether the various *-INFORMATION function can be  
trusted to work reasonably in accordance with CLtL2.
Also, somebody else before had noted that AUGMENT-ENVIRONMENT has  
disappeared from LW 5.x.   Does anybody know of a workaround?  I am  
trying to test some portable code walkers.

Cheers

Hi Marco,

I wonder if the Environments Access module might be a sort of end-run  
around the issue:

http://www.lispwire.com/entry-proganal-envaccess-des

My understanding is that this Environments Access module at one point  
compiled in all of the major lisps at the basic level, including  
Lispworks, and that it has also been ported to CMUCL at a deeper level  
(e.g. usage of the environments operators by the compiler). It would  
be cool if this open source project could be extended more deeply into  
Lispworks.

HTH,

Indeed, having portable environment access would be great.

In CLPython I need to keep track of context state, e.g. for
namespaces. In Allegro that can be done with EA using a custom
declaration (see define-declaration), which makes the context
information part of  the environment object. That feels very elegant.
In other implementations that mechanism has to be simulated using
(symbol)macros, which is a bit of a hack.
