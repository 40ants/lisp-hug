                <pre>
Hello all,

I'm trying to use a "lock file" as a mean to check if there are 2 
instances of my delivered program running.

First step is testing it, so here goes...

In a first instance of the lispworks IDE i define this :

(defvar *lock-file* nil)

(defun create-lock-file ()
  (setf *lock-file*
        (open (dir+filename (data-path) "test.lock")
              :direction :output
              :if-exists :supersede
              :if-does-not-exist :create)))

and  execute the create-lock-file function, leaving the stream open. I 
can see the file being created on my hard drive.

Then i do the same in a second instance of the IDE.. and get no error !
Even writing to the stream and calling finish-output appears to be working.
I can open the file in notepad but cannot save it.
I tried also :if-exists :overwrite.

So here is my question : how can I ensure the stream i open is 
exclusively owned by my application ?

Thanks in advance,
Sacha

I think if you change :if-exists from :supersede to :error, it will do 
what you want.
