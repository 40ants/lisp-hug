                <h1>display only editor pane</h1>
                <pre>
Is there a supported model for a display only editor pane?  I want to  
change the text with code but not allow the user to modify it. Prior  
to 5.1, I could just call editor:buffer-writable when the interface  
was created and then use #'(setf editor-pane-text) to modify it. With  
LispWorks 5.1, I get an error that the buffer is read-only.

Can you wrap

  (editor:process-character
    (lambda (p) (declare (ignore p))
      (setf (editor:buffer-writable your-buffer-var) t))
    your-window-var)
  #| ... |#
  (editor:process-character
    (lambda (p) (declare (ignore p))
      (setf (editor:buffer-writable your-buffer-var) nil))
    your-window-var)

around your change?  Or did you consider that and were just hoping for
something more elegant?
