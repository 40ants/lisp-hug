                <h1>Problem compiling Maxima</h1>
                <pre>
Dear all.

I tried to compile the Maxima computer algebra system (version 5.16.1) 
with Lispworks Personal 5.1.1. Running configure.lisp, (maxima-compile) 
and (maxima-load) all passed without problems, but after (cl-user::run) 
I got the followiung error message:
 Undefined function HARLEQUIN-COMMON-LISP:GETENV called with arguments 
("MAXIMA_LANG_SUBDIR").
Does anybody know how to circument this?

Yours,
Reinhard Oldenburg

You probably want to use LW:ENVIRONMENT-VARIABLE instead.

huh...interesting...I didn't know a version of Macsyma was even still  
around...20+ years ago I  traveled to Los Alamos (with my machine)  
and ported DOE-Macsyma to the TI Explorer Lisp Machine...twice (first  
time was Rel 2 (1986), second was the much more CL Rel 3 (1988)).

one of the things I did was take a self-test mechanism (which I think  
originated with Bill Shelter at UT, but didn't work, and his macsyma  
attempt didn't work either) and make it behave cleanly, and create a  
set of self-tests which you could batch-run to verify build-tests.  
this was important because that was some god-awfully sloppy code,  
that was also just about incomprehensible, and written for previous  
dialects of Lisp that had subtle differences (heck, on the Explorer  
itself I got weirdly different behaviors, depending on how I compiled  
things (defsystem vs file vs function) that took me a while to figure  
out)

haven't thought about that in years...wonder if I still have that old  
monster on backup tape...it'd be a shame for that code/tool to just  
vanish...there ought to be a way to "productize" an open version of  
it, I'd think.

what is the origin of this Macsyma version?

Bill Shelter got the DOE to open up the source of the 1982 version
under the GPL. It's still enhanced and maintained by a group of people
after his death. Too bad all the Symbolics enhancements and man years
of development on it will be locked up forever.

&gt Well, that's only a question of money. Currently no buyer with
&gt sufficient cash has been identified. AFAIK that's the main problem.

You're probably better informed about Symbolics than I but I'd heard
the Symbolics assets were tied up in probate with the death of the
previous owner. Of course, that's also nothing cash and lawyers can't
solve but it can make it a lot more expensive.

The problem is that the previous owner (who is now dead) owed the IRS
a lot of money and there's no heir, so the executor keeps the assets
and tries to find someone who is willing to pay enough money for them
to make the IRS happy.  It seems this hasn't happened so far and
probably it never will.

Edi.

&gt   
Edi is right.  This is being handled, and there's nothing anyone else
can do about
it.  Please do NOT try to get involved, or else the trustees of the
estate will think
that they can start a bidding war.  We just have to wait until they give up.

I think the idea was just to pick up the changes that were made to
Macsyma by Symbolics,
rather than use Genera as a development environment.

Yeah, I'm also dubious that much of Genera could be used easily by anyone
there days.  There were lots of good ideas in the software that one could
learn about by using it, but actually transplanting the code may not be that
useful.
