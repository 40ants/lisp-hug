                <h1>unused variable warning</h1>
                <pre>
It seems to me that I used to get an assumed special warning in
something like the following, although I don't have an older version
handy to check with. I'm on LWM 5.1.1


CL-USER 1 &gt (defun test ()
              (dolist (x '(1 2 3 4 5))
                stray-variable
                x))
TEST

CL-USER 2 &gt (test)
NIL

CL-USER 3 &gt (compile 'test)
TEST
NIL
NIL

Even if it's not the default to warn (I can see where the reference
would be removed since it doesn't have an effect), is there a way to
get a warning on this kind of code? Thanks!

Hmmm, I'm not sure if this could ever have warned about stray-variable
being assumed special.
&gtFrom the CLHS entry on dolist, in the Notes Section;

"go may be used within the body of dolist to transfer control to a
statement labeled by a tag."

Which means that the 'stray-variable' symbol in your function is being
used as a tag.
Without the dolist everything does work as you expect.


(defun foo ()
  foobar)

;;;*** Warning in FOO: FOOBAR assumed special


cheers,
 sean.

Ah, that's exactly it. Thanks. And to provide an example of the
behavior I'd expect in other situations:

CL-USER 1 &gt (defun test ()
              stray-variable
              (list 1 2 3))
TEST

CL-USER 2 &gt (compile 'test)
;;;*** Warning in TEST: STRAY-VARIABLE assumed special
TEST
((NIL #&lt;CONDITIONS::SIMPLE-STYLE-WARNING 21D0AA6B&gt))
NIL

I'd just forgotten about that implicit tagbody within dolist. Thanks!
