                <h1>Rational = float</h1>
                <pre>
I found a bug in my codes witch was due to a comparison between a fractional
number and a float number. Because the float number is a 'limited' float
with max 2 numbers after the point (and is always rational) I thought it
works because :

(= 1.0 1) =&gt T
(= 0.5 1/2) =&gt T
(= 0.25 1/4) =&gt T
(= 1.125 9/8) =&gt T
Etc.

But in fact

(= 0.2 1/5) =&gt NIL

Is it correct to say that the denominator of the rational must always be a
power of two  to make a valid comparison with a float ?

In addition, is it a operator that return T for the test of comparison of
0.2 and 1/5 ? Or is it the best solution to make (= 0.2 (float 1/5)) ?

Thanks

Denis

&gt 
&gt This condition is sufficient but might not be necessary.

&gt    comparison of 0.2 and 1/5 ? Or is it the best solution to make (=
&gt    0.2 (float 1/5)) ?
&gt 
&gt See the "Rule of Float and Rational Contagion"
&gt 
&gt http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/12_ada.htm

Ah yes, so :

(rational 0.2) =&gt 13421773/67108864 (glup...)

And then (= 13421773/67108864 1/5) =&gt NIL (here I understand something)

And, as says Espen : (rationalize 0.2) =&gt 1/5 (ouf!)

But is not the RATIONALIZE function too expensive in term of performances to
generalize a (rationalize float) mechanism ? Hmmm...

Fortunately, I use float for displaying convenience and not really for
computation. So I thing I could simply avoid this comparison (and it will
certainly be more prudent)

Thanks for your very interesting explanations (and the others I received)

Denis

&gt 
&gt The 1/5 is coerced to a float as part of the = operation.
&gt 
&gt The real issue is: you should always (in any programming language) be
&gt extremely wary when comparing floats, which by their very nature can
&gt never be guaranteed exact. Both 0.2 and (float 1/5) have to be inexact
&gt as IEEE floats, and it happens that they are inexact differently.
&gt 
&gt Something like
&gt 
&gt    (defun close-enough-= (this that)
&gt      (&lt; (abs (- this that))
&gt         +tolerance+))
&gt 
&gt might be more appropriate.

YMMV. It's not 100% reliable either, at least it will fool you if you
(EEK!) want to work with short-floats:

NFTPD 59 &gt (rationalize (coerce 95/100 'short-float))
41495/43679

(I don't know if that might possibly be a bug in LWs rationalize
 implementation...?)

but it works fine with all single- and double-floats from 0.01, 0.02,
...., 0.99

A power of two not greater than the number of bits in the mantissa.

Even that could fail for a number of reasons. 

If you're going to work with floating point numbers, read Goldberg's
"What every computer scientist should know about floating point
arithmetic". It's easy available on the internet.

Could we consider then that (=  1.0 1) return *always* T ?

I think (= (rationalize 0.2) 1/5) will work for your usage.
