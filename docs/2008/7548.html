                <h1>Editable grid interface</h1>
                <pre>
Hello,

I'd like to implement a kind of editable grid, with possibility to  
dynamically add columns and rows, and editing of the cells through  
freeform input and selection from a  collection (e.g. with an option- 
pane).  The application is an OS X CAPI application.

The only grid-like pane I could find is multiple-column-list-pane,  
but I could not find a way to select a single cell in it and make it  
editable. Another way would be to implement the grid as a grid layout  
where I manually lay out text-input-panes  and option-panes. Is there  
a simpler way?

Thank you, Denis.

Denis,

There are some examples (grid.lisp and grid-impl) you can find
in &lt;LispWorks dir&gt/lib/5-0-0-0/examples/capi/elements.

There is some code in public domain at http://lisp.ystok.ru/ygrid/

Finally you can roll your own stuff like I did :)

Andreas

Unfortunately, there is not a simple way to do this. The multi-column- 
list-pane corresponds to a Mac Cocoa object that has all of these  
features, so you could implement it using the Cocoa API.

a) As someone already mentioned, looked at ygrid.

b) You can make a non-editable grid in the usual way, then instantiate a 
single editor (capi:rich-text-pane or capi:edit-pane or capi:text-input-pane) 
and hide it (capi:hide-pane).  When your input-model logic determines that 
the user wants to edit a cell (for example double-click the left mouse button 
over a particular cell), you can reposition the editor pane (setf 
(capi:pinboard-pane-position ...) and capi:pinboard-pane-size) over the cell 
and use capi:show-pane to display the editor and allow in-place editing.

Didn't LispWorks once have a directory of contributed code?  The home
page still mentions it, but when I follow the link I don't find it
anymore.
