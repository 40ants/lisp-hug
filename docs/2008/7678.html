                <h1>delivered application freezing</h1>
                <pre>
Greetings,

I have a LW 5.0 delivered application 100 MB in size running on  
Veterans Administration (VA) Computers, Windows XP Professional 496  
MB of RAM, concurrently running Outlook, Word, Internet Explorer, and  
the VA computerized medical record system (CPRS).
The application seems to run efficiently, except too frequently  
freezes, forcing a delay and quitting the application. The freezing  
behavior is not reproducible. Attempts to reproduce the error result  
in the expected and desired behavior. No error is signaled.

Any suggestions on how to approach a problem like this?

Thanks,
Sheldon

I assume the app runs OK as an undelivered application on the same  
machine.  If it does, deliver the
application a level 0 and see if it triggers the debugger.  If you  
deliver the app at too high a level
you can get various crashes (without errors signaled).  The shaker  
can strip too much out the
system and cause problems (I have usually had to set some important  
delivery keywords at level 5 to
get things working)

Can you post the delivery script you are using?  It would be  
informative.  (Also, are you using
defstruct  and/or defclass in your app?)
