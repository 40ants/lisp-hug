                <h1>Multithreading on multiple processor machine ...</h1>
                <pre>
Is Lispworks set up to make use of multiple processors?  I'm testing  
a multithreaded application on couple of machines (one with two  
processors and one with a single one) and there doesn't seem to be  
any difference in performance.  I sort of expected the dual processor  
machine to be faster, but maybe things don't work that way or maybe  
I'm using the mp package incorrectly ...

I don't have to use process-allow-scheduling explicitly in my code,  
right?  sleep should allow other processes to run too, right? All my  
threads are created with process-run-function, but the main thread is  
also being used for processing.

I'm running within Lispworks version 5.0 environment using default  
image with all the patches under OS X 10.4.11.

Thanks for your help.

No, not in the sense that several processors (or cores) can run Lisp
code from the same image at the same time:

You'll need to ask LispWorks, but I don't believe they have committed
to that feature.

&gt But I guess that explains the purpose of process-allow- 
&gt scheduling ...  

Not really. P-A-S is similar to pthread_yield in Posix threads and
allows a thread to explicitly and voluntary be interrupted instead of
waiting for the scheduler to do it.

&gt Although given that I have none in my program currently, that means
&gt that something else also controls interrupts.  What are the
&gt conditions under which processes are interrupted?  

To first order, it's the same conditions that allow any thread to be
interrupted.  Commonly, it will be because the current thread/process
time slice has expired.

&gt I.e. what determines the output of the following program?
&gt (let ((listener *standard-output*)) (mp:process-run-function
&gt "helloer" nil #'(lambda () (dotimes (n 100000) (format listener "~A"
&gt hello)))) (dotimes (n 100000) (format listener "~A" 'bye)))

The scheduler determines the output.  And in general HELLO will be
mixed in with BYE.  Here's my example with some time wasting code in
the middle:

    (defun run-2 (how-many)
      (let ((listener *standard-output*)) 
        (mp:process-run-function "helloer" nil 
                                 #'(lambda () (dotimes (n how-many)
                                                (format listener "hello ")
                                                (fact 100))))
        (dotimes (n how-many) 
          (format listener "bye ")
          (fact 10000))
        (sleep 1)
        (format listener"~&amp;")))

    (defun fact (n)
      (if (&lt; n 2)
          1
          (* n (fact (1- n)))))

Try (run-2 100)
