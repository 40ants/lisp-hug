                <h1>Drop callbacks</h1>
                <pre>
Hello all, particularly Lispworks folks,

I'm playing with 5.1 (on OS X, 10.5), and I'm excited about the drag
and drop support. One question that came up very quickly as I was
playing with the example and some of mine own code.

The documentation for simple-pane reads:

drop-callback  should handle these values of stage:
:formats ...
:enter ...
:drag ...
:drop ...

I wrote up a pane with a drop callback that had

(ecase stage
  ((:formats) ...)
  ((:enter :drag) ...)
  ((:drop) ...))

and quickly got an error about having no matching case for :leave. So
I'd misread the phrase "should handle these values of stage" as being
an exhaustive list, when it's not (which is OK). I just want to check
that I'm not supposed to be doing anything for the :leave stage (or
any other stages that I haven't yet run into).

Thanks!
