                <h1>"Span" in grid layouts?</h1>
                <pre>
I'm using GRID-LAYOUT quite often to lay out CAPI panes within an
interface.  Sometimes I'm missing the ability to have some pane span
several columns or rows like it can be done in an HTML table.  Did
others here ever want the same functionality or am I missing an
already existing way to do it?

I'm considering to write my own layout class for this and of course
I'd be happy if someone told me that this is not necessary... :)

Column-layout and row-layout are subclasses of grid-layout which is a sublcass 
of x-y-adjustable-layout.  I haven't actually done this, but my first impulse 
would be to check out the abilities of these layout classes before trying to 
invent my own class...

I know about column-layout and row-layout and have used them hundreds
of times already.  Sometimes you can achieve things you can't achieve
with a grid layout by nesting these somehow.  But sometimes you can't,
at least not in a straightforward way.

Consider something like this:

    [ PANE1 ] [ PANE2 ]
  [  PANE3  ] [ PANE4 ]
  [  PANE5  ] [  PANE6  ]
    [      PANE7      ]
    [ PANE8 ] [  PANE9  ]

I want the panes on the left to be right-adjusted and the panes on the
right to be left-adjusted.  If it weren't for the fourth row, I could
simply use a grid layout with :x-adjust '(:right :left).  If it
weren't for the /fifth/ row, I could use such a grid layout for the
first three rows and a centered row layout for the fourth line.  But I
want the panes in the fifth row to be aligned with the panes in the
first three rows.

As I said, in an HTML table this would be done with something like
colspan=2.  In CAPI, I'm not aware of an easy way to do it.

No... :)

Maybe if I find some spare time.  It may be interesting as I've never
done my own layouts before.

Incidentally, is there example code somewhere for creating your own
layouts?

Ugh, I could have sworn I had looked there recently without finding
anything... :)

Thanks,
