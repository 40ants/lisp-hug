                <h1>Deliver and multiprocessing</h1>
                <pre>
Hello,

after delivering at level 4 (on a mac intel, LW 5.02), my application runs
correctly, except for a multiprocessing related problem : I have some
background-processes created at launch time. Some operations in these
processes works normally, but some other not. It seems that the problem even
occurs when capi:display is called from one of these processes.
(but when running the same codes in LW there is no problem).

In this situation I get this error just after the interface is displayed :

Error: MP:CHANGE-PROCESS-PRIORITY called with a dead process: #&lt;MP:PROCESS
Name :DEAD-PROCESS Priority 0 State "Dead"&gt.
  1 (abort) Allow MyProcess to proceed to next job.
  2 Abort job known as MyProcess.

Here is the backtrace :

Call to "GET-CALL-FRAME"
Call to "DEBUG1"
Call to "INVOKE-DEBUGGER"
Call to "CONDITIONS-ERROR"
Call to "CHANGE-PROCESS-PRIORITY"
Call to "PROCESS-MAYBE-GOING-TO-SLEEP"
Call to "PROCESS-READ-EVENT"
Call to "LOOP-PROCESS-EVENTS"
Call to "RUN-IN-PROCESS"
Call to "DISPLAY"
Call to "LOAD-FILE-WITH-MESSAGE"
Call to "MAKE-BACKGROUND-PROCESS .  WORKER"
Call to "INITIALIZE-PROCESS-STACK .  PROCESS-SG-FUNCTION"
Call to "%%FIRST-CALL-TO-STACK"


This is non related to a explicit call to CHANGE-PROCESS-PRIORITY in my
codes. My processes are alive, and I do not not kill any process during the
live of the application. So, I can't figure out where this dead process come
from... 

Thanks by advance for any idea


Denis

Excuse-me, it appears that capi:display has to be call in the
Cocoa *main-process*.  Why when deliver and not otherwise ? I don't know...
But now it works.

Best
