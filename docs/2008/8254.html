                <h1>Editor hanging bug?</h1>
                <pre>
Hi all,

I'm just about certain this is a bug, but I'm wondering if anyone can
confirm this on any other setups. I'm on LWM 5.1.1, PPC G5, running OS
X 10.5. Starting a vanilla lispworks, the following causes all of LW
to hang up.

Open a new buffer (File, New...)
Input:

(defun foo ()
  "

Press Ctrl-Space (to push a point)
Press Up.
The active region should now be crossing the boundary of an incomplete
string, but I'm not sure if that's related to the problem or not. I've
put a short screencapture of this at

http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~tayloj/lwbug.mov

I checked the knowledge base and didn't find anything. If there aren't
any known workarounds, and this isn't a known issue, I'll submit a bug
report.

Thanks all,
//JT

Works for me.  LWL 5.1.1.  Though I don't think it's completely
vanilla.  Are you sure you're loading all patches and all that?

Yes. Usually I use LW-ADD-ONS, and so at first I thought it might be a
bug with the transient-mark-mode simulation, but I started LW from
Terminal.app, specifying -init -. The transcript from Terminal.app
follows:

And at this point, I'm in the LW IDE. For what it's worth, this also
seems to be in LWL 5.1.0. That is, the following sequence gives me the
bug too.
