Remember that remove returns a copy of the list. It doesn't change the  
original list. So (apply #'+ lst) is still referring to the original  
list.

Try

(defun summit (lst)
	(apply #'+
		(remove nil lst)))

Happy learning. It's an enlightening journey.

Firstly, the syntax of defun is

(defun &lt;name&gt &lt;args&gt
   &lt;body&gt)

So you want

(defun summit (lst)
   ...)

Secondly, remove is a function. It doesn't alter its arguments, it  
returns a new list. Consider typing these forms in the listener:

 &gt (setf list '(1 2 3))
==&gt (1 2 3)
 &gt (remove 2 list)
==&gt (1 3)
 &gt list
==&gt (1 2 3)

The call to remove returned what I want but my list is the same after  
the call.

Lastly, you may want to look up the function reduce.

Regards.

&gt (defun (summit ( lst) (remove nil lst) (apply #' + lst))

1. No parenthesis between defun and summit.
2. (remove nil lst) doesn't change lst, it returns a list which you can 
subsequently use.

So: (defun summit (lst) (apply #'+ (remove nil lst)))

reduce could be used instead of apply, but I don't know if that is an 
improvement.

It is likely that someone will mention that this list is primarily, if 
not exclusively for Lispworks-specific topics. But I enjoy the 
infrequent occasion when I can offer an answer.

For something like that I would not use remove.  Just iterate through  
the
list and sum the non nils.


(defun sum-non-nil (list)
   (loop for n in list when n sum n))
