                <pre>A non-lisp option is to use irfanview. It has a batch mode that will perform the resize, rename, file move &amp; conversion of any number of files as a single operation. Your requirement to crop images automatically may be problematic though. 

Windows only though.

There is a Common Lisp interface to Image magic.

I mis-spoke slightly. I don't actually have any files myself I need 
resized.    I am working on a Lisp application that needs to operate on 
image files in those ways.

I know about the bindings to image-magick, but was hoping to perform 
everything using Lisp only.  Plus, I seem to recall that image-magick is 
GPL.


And, most annoying of all, I am convinced that the LispWorks GP: 
functions are capable of doing these operations. I have an old laptop 
around here somewhere, maybe my toy code is there.
