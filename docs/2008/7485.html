Hi all,

Quick question (sorry for absence of details). 

Any suggestion what I ought to look for when building an application
from a delivery script which aborts and complains that a package cannot be
found? My first look at this reveals nothing different about the
particular "missing" package from all others the delivery succeeds
in finding.

I'm hoping there are some obvious things to look for, which my lack of
experience with this denies me.

Thanks so much,
B.Connoy

You might want to look at doc for :delete-packages and
:packages-to-keep keywords in the Delivery Users Guide, and generally
do a search on "package" in that doc and think about whatever you
find.
