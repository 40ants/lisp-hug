                <h1>The right idiom for reading from CAPI panes</h1>
                <pre>
&gtFrom time to time I re-read parts of the LispWorks manuals to refresh
my recollection.  (You see things you've read before in a different
light after some years when you've used them extensively in the
meantime...)

Today, I stumbled across this sentence which is repeated in several
places, for example in the entry for CAPI:APPLY-IN-PANE-PROCESS in the
CAPI Reference Manual:

  All accesses (reads as well as writes) on a pane should be performed
  in the panes' process.

Yes, we've all learned to love and hate CAPI:APPLY-IN-PANE-PROCESS for
manipulating CAPI panes from another thread, but I have to admit that
today for the first time I really thought about the "READS as well as
writes" part of this sentence.  I don't think I ever thought about
processes when I was just reading values from a CAPI pane and I'm
petty sure I never had problems related to that.

If I understand the part about reads correctly, one would have to code
like I did in the example below, right?  Do you guys really do that?
Or is there a better idiom I'm missing?

Or is this really a non-issue or only relevant for very special cases?
After all, if I look at the entry for CAPI:CHECK-BUTTON-PANEL in the
CAPI Reference Manual, /they/ just read from the panel without using
CAPI:APPLY-IN-PANE-PROCESS... :)

Curious,
Edi.

Subject: The right idiom for reading from CAPI panes

Let me guess: If one process reads from the pane, without CAPI:APPLY-IN-PANE-PROCESS, while another writes to the pane, with or without CAPI:APPLY-IN-PANE-PROCESS: What does the reader see? I believe it will be surprised, at least sometimes.

What would the difference between the reader using A-I-P-P or not be
in my example?  It can get the list of selected items /before/ or
/after/ the writer modifies the pane, it doesn't know either way.

So, the only reasonable problem I could imagine is that it's neither
before or after but really "at the same time" and the writer is
interrupted in the middle of some non-atomic operation which would
result in the reader getting invalid data.  (Of course, this
presumably can't happen with A-I-P-P as - my understanding - reader
and writer are queued and their requested operations are performed
sequentially.)

So, if one needs to use A-I-P-P to be guarded against a case like I
described in the last paragraph, isn't this more a general issue of
what's atomic and what not in MP?

Trying to be more precise - in my particular example the reader
receives ("a pointer to") a cons cell and I have a hard time imagining
how it could end up receiving an invalid pointer, even in a scenario
like the one Martin described here:

Sorry for talking to myself, but after a cigarette I had some new
ideas... :)

The button panel CLOS object is of course not the real thing but, as
the CAPI User Guide explains, only a representation of the window
object of the underlying windowing system.  Let's call the CAPI object
C and the windowing object W.

To return the value of (CHOICE-SELECTED-ITEMS C), CAPI will under the
hood probably perform some pseudo-machine code like this (I'm thinking
of the translation of something like LOOP ... COLLECT):

  A1.  Create a Lisp list L1.

  A2.  Read status of first checkbox from W.
  A3.  Set first element of L1 according to step A2.

  A4.  Read status of second checkbox from W.
  A5.  Set second element of L1 according to step A4.

  A6.  Read status of third checkbox from W.
  A7.  Set third element of L1 according to step A6.

  A8.  Read status of fourth checkbox from W.
  A9.  Set fourth element of L1 according to step A8.

  A10. Return L1.

To /set/ the value of (CHOICE-SELECTED-ITEMS C) to some new value L2,
the operations will maybe look like this:

  B1.  Get first element of L2.
  B2.  Set status of first checkbox of W according to B1.

  B3.  Get second element of L2.
  B4.  Set status of second checkbox of W according to B3.

  B5.  Get third element of L2.
  B6.  Set status of third checkbox of W according to B5.

  B7.  Get fourth element of L2.
  B8.  Set status of fourth checkbox of W according to B7.

Now, let's say the current selection is (T NIL T NIL) meaning that the
first and the third checkbox are checked.  Due to some GUI interaction
(user presses button elsewhere) the application wants to
programmatically set the selection to (NIL T NIL T), i.e. second and
fourth checkbox.  This is done via B1 to B8 and happens in the
interface thread where it should happen.

At the same time some sloppy code from Edi tries to read the selection
from another thread and doesn't use APPLY-IN-PANE-PROCESS.  Steps A1
to A10 are performed.  The OS decides to schedule this as follows:

  A1 A2 A3          ;; L1 is (T) so far
  B1 B2 B3 B4       ;; second checkbox marked as checked
  A4 A5 A6 A7       ;; L1 is now (T T T)
  B5 B6 B7 B8       ;; fourth checkbox marked as checked
  A8 A9 A10         ;; return value for L1 is (T T T T)

So, my code will receive the bogus result (T T T T) meaning all four
checkboxes are checked which reflects a state that never happened in
the "real world."

Hmm, I think I just convinced myself.  But maybe this is also bogus.
Does it make sense?

The question remains, though, why the CAPI Reference Manual itself
doesn't follow its own rules...

Hi David,

&gt But I think part of the confusion stems from our lack of knowledge
&gt about the nature of the thread switching mechanism -- when it

Agreed.  My /guess/ is that the "when" part is decided by the OS as
the threads are native.

&gt The LW manual states that only one Lisp thread can run at a time,
&gt and that a lock is used to ensure this. I take that to mean that
&gt even if the OS preempts a Lisp thread, no other Lisp thread could
&gt possibly run until / unless the first thread releases the lock.

That's not how I understand it.  I thought that the order of execution
is more or less completely determined externally (i.e. by the OS)
/except/ that you can rely on things happening sequentially and not in
parallel - as if you were on a single-CPU-single-core machine.

My naive picture is that the OS starts and stops the various Lisp
threads at will and they basically do what they're told to.  But first
they look at the "big lock" and if it says that some other Lisp thread
from the same image is already running (which must be in another core
or on another CPU), they refuse to run and go back to sleep.

But even if my understanding is wrong, I'm still hoping that in the
not-so-distant future LispWorks will be fully SMP-capable anyway.  At
that point, certainly all bets are off, and my convoluted example
would be valid.

Maybe the manual just wants us to be prepared for this bright
future... :)

Cheers,
Edi.

&gt I just had a response, from someone watching this thread of

&gt something we are aiming for. And I think Lisp could shine in this
&gt regard.

I've just started reading Joe Armstrong's recently-released Erlang
book and the language certainly sports a couple of interesting
concepts.  I wouldn't really want to write large applications in it,
being a dyed-in-the-wool Lisper, but it's probably a good idea to
steal something from it.

And, as you might remember from Klaus Harbo's talk in Hamburg, his
CL-MUPROC library already implements a way to deal with
multi-threading the Erlang way.  If one adheres to that, one can
probably avoid a lot of headache.

  http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-muproc/

My understanding is that the main difference to Lisp that remains is
that Erlang "processes" are a lot cheaper to create than OS threads as
they are implemented in user land.  But that is obviously only an
issue when you have very, very many processes.  I certainly wouldn't
want to go back to "green" threads in CL, though, as for example you'd
lose the ability to be called back from foreign code that LispWorks
has.

As for Erlang's "hot upgrades" it is not totally clear to me how that
differs from modifying a running Lisp system.  Maybe someone with more
Erlang fu can explain this.

Or maybe we should stop here as this is certainly not
LispWorks-specific anymore and might thus be in the wrong forum...

Is it prudent or paranoid to include a timeout in case selected-items 
doesn't return? (as described previously in gmane) but which could now 
use mp:process-wait-with-timeout.

                 <h1>Firewall Problem: LW self modifying executable bundle on Mac?</h1>
                 <pre>
The Mac OS 10.5 firewall makes a hash for approved apps and then checks against it on launch.  Our LispWorks app fails the test every time after the first launch and is thus blocked by the Firewall.

One suspicion is that LW is changing something.  

Any ideas about what LW might be changing in the app bundle that is causing this and how to stop it from doing so?

Thanks!

We haven't "signed" our app for 10.5.  Could that be the problem?  If so, why does it run the first time?
