                <h1>Disassembling a method</h1>
                <pre>
Is there an easy way that I'm missing to disassemble a specific
method?  I can go from the generic function to the specific method and
its associated functional object via the MOP and/or the inspector and
disassemble it (see below), but I'm looking for a direct invocation.
"Disassemble Definition" in the IDE seem to work only for plain
functions and I wouldn't know what to hand over to the CL:DISASSEMBLE
function to do this in one step.  Any ideas?

Thanks,
Edi.

Frankly I'm not sure what you're looking for but I'll take my best
shot.  :)

Poking at the listener and the inspector came up with this:

  CL-USER 35 &gt (defmethod foo ((a integer)) (1+ a))
  #&lt;STANDARD-METHOD FOO NIL (INTEGER) 22535AF3&gt

  CL-USER 36 &gt (disassemble (slot-value * 'function))
  225464C2:
	 0:      55               push  ebp
  [ ... etc ... ]

Or maybe you want this?

  (disassemble 
    (slot-value (find-method #'foo '() (list (find-class 'integer)))
		'function))

Or something else?  IOW what's your ideal call sequence to get what
you want?

(This use of slot-value may be LW-specific, but the find-method came
right out of the CLHS.)

A /convenient/ way to see the disassembly of the method.  If you've
identified a specific function FOO as a bottleneck and you want to
optimize it, then it sometimes makes sense to look at its disassembly.
The usual cycle for me might be to change the function's definition in
the source file, then "Compile Defun", then to disassemble it either
with "Disassemble Definition" or with typing

  (disassemble 'foo)

into the listener (and maybe repeat this with M-p after
recompilation).  With methods, the first variant ("Disassemble
Definition") doesn't work.  For the second variant, I'm looking for
something I can type into the REPL which is short and unambiguous.

&gt CL-USER 36 &gt (disassemble (slot-value * 'function))

This'll only help if you define your methods in the listener which I
usually don't do.

&gt   (disassemble 
&gt     (slot-value (find-method #'foo '() (list (find-class 'integer)))
&gt 		'function))

That's more like it albeit a bit bulky.  I had hoped that I could
maybe use the DSPEC stuff to identify the specific method.

&gt (This use of slot-value may be LW-specific, but the find-method came
&gt right out of the CLHS.)

Yeah, I'm aware that any such solution will be LW-specific.  That's
fine.

Thanks,
Edi.

&gt This even works with "Disassemble Definition" -- tell it "(foo

That's very helpful, thanks!

Edi.

Would something change for the better if one replaced symbol-function
with fdefinition in Larry's code?
