                <h1>Running out of graphics memory</h1>
                <pre>
I have a pinboard with a few thousand pinboard-objects on it.  In order 
to start with a blank pinboard, I set the layout-description to nil and 
then populate it with new objects. After doing this a few times, the 
objects no longer appear and I see a blank pinboard.  I know the objects 
are there because I can get information about them via my input-model.

It seems like I'm running out of graphics memory. Is this the correct 
diagnosis and is there a way to avoid this situation?

This is with LW 5.1 and XP. Thanks for any help.

Mitch

I continue to encounter this issue and would be grateful to hear whether 
this is something I could potentially fix.
