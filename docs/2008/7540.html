Im sorry, but I don't know how I got on this list, but can the administrator please remove me or can someone inform me on how to do it. I have used lispworks but it was for a class, and I do not use it anymore. Thank you all and I apologize for any inconvenience.

&gt   Whoa! Edi!
&gt   You have certainly given me a lot of stuff to chew
&gt   on... 
&gt   I just had a response, from someone watching this
&gt   thread of conversation, that he has used Erlang for
&gt   such cases. I have used Erlang in the past, but I
&gt   didn't realize its kernel was fully re-entrant. But
&gt   Erlang's in-situ module update philosophy is
&gt   certainly something we are aiming for. And I think
&gt   Lisp could shine in this regard.
&gt   But your response here shows me what a remarkable
&gt   mind you have. I am impressed!

&gt     Hi David,
&gt     Thanks for your thoughts on this.  Your analysis
&gt     makes it pretty
&gt     obvious that my idea about how the "big lock" is
&gt     implemented was
&gt     wrong.  And your test cases also inspired me to
&gt     play around a bit
&gt     more.  Here are some findings:
&gt      1. I did all my tests on Windows, but
&gt     unsurprisingly the results were
&gt         the same as yours on OS X.
&gt      2. In case someone here cares, AllegroCL (8.1 on
&gt     Windows) exposes the
&gt         same behaviour.  You can also lock up its
&gt     IDE completely if your
&gt         threads keep the Lisp image busy.
&gt      3. This is a machine with an Intel Core 2 Duo,
&gt     i.e. it has two cores.
&gt         As expected, with both LispWorks and
&gt     AllegroCL the CPU utilization
&gt         never went beyond 50%.
&gt      4. I then ran the tests on a 64-bit Linux (same
&gt     hardware) using
&gt         OpenMCL.  The listener there remained fully
&gt     responsive and the CPU
&gt         was at 100%.
&gt      5. I was then reminded of the remark in the
&gt     LispWorks manuals that
&gt         while there can only be one Lisp thread at a
&gt     time there could be
&gt         other threads executing foreign code in
&gt     parallel.  That obviously
&gt         means that whenever the Lisp calls into FLI
&gt     land, the OS must get
&gt         a chance to switch threads.  So, I modified
&gt     your test code a
&gt         little (see attachment) to see how usage of
&gt     the FLI might affect
&gt         the results.
&gt      6. First of all, the high optimization settings
&gt     in FOO1 are there for
&gt         a reason.  If you don't have them, a call
&gt     to (TEST) will make the
&gt         IDE a bit sluggish but it won't lock it
&gt     up.  My guess is that Lisp
&gt         functions usually relinquish the big lock at
&gt     their entry points,
&gt         but it seems you can optimize that away.
&gt      7. The next (at least to me) surprising result
&gt     is that DOIT1-2 is
&gt         actually faster than DOIT1-1 - on my machine
&gt     it's approximately
&gt         6.5 seconds vs. 8.5 seconds.  I have no
&gt     explanation for this.
&gt      8. Now for the real test: A call to (TEST) will,
&gt     as I already said,
&gt         lock up the IDE.  Also, if you look at
&gt     *COUNT1* and *COUNT2* after
&gt         the test is finished, you'll see that either
&gt     one of the threads
&gt         didn't run at all or that they both managed
&gt     to finish completely
&gt         without being killed.  This is equivalent
&gt     to your original code.
&gt         A call to (TEST :FLI T) OTOH will /not/ lock
&gt     up the IDE.
&gt         Specifically, you can investigate the
&gt     counters while the test is
&gt         running and you'll see that both threads are
&gt     progressing.  So,
&gt         even with this "simulated FLI call" the big
&gt     lock loses its power.
&gt      9. The priority setting doesn't seem to make a
&gt     big difference for
&gt         these tests.
&gt     10. Now look at the value of *FOO* after (TEST
&gt     :FLI T) has finished.
&gt         It is not what one would expect it to be if
&gt     there were some kind
&gt         of atomicity guarantee for the SETQ form. 
&gt     I think this shows what
&gt         you'll have to deal with once you're working
&gt     with a real
&gt         SMP-capable Lisp.
&gt     Let me finally drive this long-winded message back
&gt     home to my original
&gt     topic.  Do you remember my toy example with the
&gt     A1-A2-A3-... and
&gt     B1-B2-B3-... sequences?  Now, as LispWorks must
&gt     call into the native
&gt     windowing system in both cases (A and B), there's
&gt     certainly some FLI
&gt     machinery involved.  So, it isn't completely
&gt     unthinkable that there
&gt     actually /are/ thread switches within these
&gt     sequences.  Most likely
&gt     there won't be enough back and forth for the
&gt     invalid return value to
&gt     really show up, but I wouldn't be 100% sure that
&gt     reading from CAPI
&gt     objects from the wrong thread is always totally
&gt     safe.
&gt     OK, that's it for now.  Any comments?
&gt     Cheers,
&gt     Edi.
&gt     PS: Maybe I /do/ have an explanation for #7 above
&gt     (or maybe this is
&gt         just nonsense).  I could imagine some kind
&gt     of "thread congestion"
&gt         going on there - the OS is trying to give
&gt     time slices to other
&gt         Lisp threads (the IDE has some), but they
&gt     always immediately
&gt         return because DOIT1-1 doesn't give up the
&gt     big lock.  This results
&gt         in the DOIT1-1 thread having an unfair share
&gt     of the execution time
&gt         alloted to the whole process and thus
&gt     increases the pressure on
&gt         the OS to try even harder to switch to other
&gt     threads.  In other
&gt         words, the time difference one can observe
&gt     is mostly owed to
&gt         "failed" attempts to switch threads and it's
&gt     not time spent in the
&gt         Lisp loops.  Does that make sense?
