                <h1>Datagram/UDP support</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

I know this question has been asked before, but it remains unanswered:  
I think it really silly that such a professional CL implementation and  
environment like LispWorks doesn't include support for Datagram/UDP  
out of the box, across all platforms. Java has it, Allegro CL has it,  
it is even pretty simple in C. The needed API to be added to COMM can  
be very small:

Using a datagram-socket class,

	(make-instance 'datagram-socket)

for a client-style socket, or

	(make-instance 'datagram-socket :port 12345)

for a server-style socket, additional keywords like
:read-timeout could added as well

The 2 essential function could be:

	(send-datagram datagram-socket host port bytes)

to send a datagram, returning nothing, and possibly
signalling some conditions and

	(receive-datagram datagram-socket)
	=&gt bytes, host, port

to receive a datagram, returning 3 values, the bytes,
a host and a port, blocking during read-timeout, or

	(receive-datagram datagram-socket buffer)
	=&gt bytes-read, host, port

with the option to pass a predefined buffer to
be filled, like in read-sequence, returning the 3
values bytes-received, host, port, possibly some
condition could be signalled here too and finally,

	(close datagram-socket)

How long could this take LispWorks' developers to implement ?
Does this really require 'Chargeable Support Incidents' ?
How many ?
Anybody else wants this too ?

Sven

This looks like something you should send to LW Support and not to the
mailing list.

I don't have a pressing need for it.  I remember I used it once years
ago (in Perl) and at that time I was happy to have it available.  So,
I certainly wouldn't mind if it were suddenly there in the next
release... :)

It would still be nice to have it out of the box :-)

And try this: (use Subversion to get it)

LispWorks-UDP, UDP Server/Client support for LispWorks:

$ svn co https://cl-net-snmp.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cl-net-snmp/lispworks-udp/trunk

I wrote it for SNMP which based on UDP, it's pure lisp and FLI-based.  
It's almost stable. See test.lisp for sample use.

P.S. There's at least one customer whom used my LispWorks-UDP package  
for porting UDP-based project from MCL to LW.
