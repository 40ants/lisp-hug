                <h1>Editor key binding questions</h1>
                <pre>
I've read the manuals but I'm still unable to find the answers to
these questions:

1) How do I rebind the isearch "search again" keys? The default isearch
   keys are bound to C-r and C-s, right? And to search for the next
   occurence, press C-r or C-s again, right? Binding the "Incremental
   Search" and "Reverse Incremental Search" commands are done using
   editor:bind. Now, how do I rebind the "search again" keys? I've
   looked at searchcomms.lisp but I still seem to be lost.

2) How do I bind the keys F10 and Control-Tab? Is F10 is bound
   exclusively in Motif to be the "menu" key? How about Control-Tab?
   (I'm using LWF)

OK. Is there no way to override the F10 key? If the answer is no, then
it's OK. Maybe I'll just have to live with that, but I still want to (re)bind
Control-Tab.

Isn't Control-Tab captured by your window manager? The window manager
will grab the keys before LispWorks gets a change. E.g. I had to rebound
a couple of KDE's default bindings to not clash with my LispWorks key bindings.

No. It isn't grabbed by my window manager. Pressing Control-Tab moves the
focus to the bar between the "main" area and the echo area. When the bar is
active, pressing the Up or Down arrow keys, resizes the echo area.

openmotif doesn't seem to ship with that man VirtualBindings page.
However it does ship with man(1) xmbind.  This didn't work for me, but
it is from openmotif 2.3 while lw links against openmotif 2.2 libs.

I never tried to remove the keyboard-menu functionality, [and now that I
tried, I'm unsuccessful], but I move the functionality from
F10/Shitf-F10, to F12/Shift-F12 using an Xdefaults setting.

Interactively:

$ cat .osf12
*defaultVirtualBindings: \
	osfMenuBar	:		&lt;Key&gtF12\n\
	osfMenu		:	Shift	&lt;Key&gtF12

$ xrdb .osf12

$ lispworks

should free up the  F10 key for your application.
