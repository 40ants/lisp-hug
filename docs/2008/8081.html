                <h1>What is #.(enable-meta-syntax)?</h1>
                <pre>
I'm trying to compile langutils, which is basically only supported on  
Allegro (boo hiss). I've fixed a couple of things while trying to asdf  
it into the system, but I think it's dying on this line:

#.(enable-meta-syntax)

Does anyone know what this is, exactly? I'm getting the following error:

**++++ Error in (TOP-LEVEL-FORM 19):
  Object #&lt;Function META::META-READER 215608B2&gt is of type FUNCTION  
which is not externalizable to #&lt;STREAM::LATIN-1-FILE-STREAM /Users/ 
paladin/dev/lisp/packages/langutils-1.0/langutils/src/t_tokenize.xfasl&gt.

Or am I wrong in thinking this is the problem? Anyone?

Cheers,

Hi John,

I'm not very familiar with langutils but I have seen the error you are  
getting before. A similar error will occur in Lispworks if you try  
something like

(defun foo (x y &amp;key (fun #'identity))
	(eq x (funcall fun y)))

The issue is that you have named a function (#'identity) and told the  
compiler to write it out to the fasl. In general, the compiler can't  
do this because functions are not "externalizable" (I don't recall  
when the spec says this but it is there somewhere...). The work around  
in this silly example is to _name_ the function rather than specifying  
it directly. E.g.,

(defun foo (x y &amp;key (fun 'identity))
	(eq x (funcall fun y)))

I tried to get the meta stuff working in a similar fashion but didn't  
have any luck. A better strategy may be to pull out anything that  
needs to have a different readtable and compile/load those separately  
using a special asdf component type. I can try this eventually but  
probably not for a week or two. Let me know.
