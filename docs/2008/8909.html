                <h1>eliding layout</h1>
                <pre>
Does someone know how to correctly make a child panes disappear (become invisible) when defining one's own layout?  (E.g. using interpret-description, calculate-constraints and calculate-layout).

I'm trying to define a simple column layout which can elide sub-panes dynamically.  I'm doing this by setting %width% and %height% to 0 in calculate-layout for the panes that I want to make temporarily invisible.  This appears to work if the child is a pane, but doesn't work when the child is itself a layout (in which case, the sub-layout remains visible but appears to shrink to its minimum size).

I'm trying to build a property sheet gui that contains zillions of properties grouped into "categories" which the user can turn "on" and "off".

ps. I'm doing this because I think that tree-view does not allow children to be layouts or panes.  Let me know if I'm wrong, since tree-view has the general functionality that I want.

Hello Paul,

| Does someone know how to correctly make a child panes disappear (become
| invisible) when defining one's own layout?  (E.g. using
| interpret-description, calculate-constraints and calculate-layout).
| 
| I'm trying to define a simple column layout which can elide sub-panes
| dynamically.  I'm doing this by setting %width% and %height% to 0 in
| calculate-layout for the panes that I want to make temporarily
| invisible.  This appears to work if the child is a pane, but doesn't
| work when the child is itself a layout (in which case, the sub-layout
| remains visible but appears to shrink to its minimum size).

capi:hide-pane also works for a pane but does not for layout.

I would suggest a tree-view accompanied by
 - either capi:switchable-layout,
 - or capi:row-layout modified via (setf capi:layout-description),
 - or plist-grid mentioned a year ago.
