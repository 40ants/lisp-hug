On Windows, the LispWorks IDE itself has, like many other
applications, a small hatched triangle in the lower right corner that
one can use to resize the window.  However, my own CAPI windows never
have such a triangle.  Is there a way for me to get this as well?

It's been a while since I wrote raw Win32 code and I'm not a CAPI guy,
but these things are usually controlled by window styles at creation
time.  I think this one is WS_SIZEBOX.

Hi Edi,

in my capi:interface I use :message-area t which gives me a "Resize Triangle" within the message area.

Ah, yes, wonderful, exactly what I wanted!

Thanks,
