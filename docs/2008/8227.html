                <h1>Interface builder width of gui and panes</h1><p>Hello I&#39;m new to the list.</p><p>I am trying to build a gui for a windows program I am writing and I decided to try out the interface builder. I haven&#39;t mastered it by any means but it does seem to make creating the basics much easier. The issues I am seeing are:</p>
<p>1- When I save the GUI I created it often saves multiple copies of the gui code in the same file. Like a backup of what it originally was. I see this when I edit the gui in the code view. Is this by design?</p><p></p><p>
2- I have a row in which I have a series of option-text-panes with varying widths, 40, 200, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 200 which totals to 640 for example, however the width of the overall dialog keeps returning to like 777 and leaves gaps between&nbsp; each option-text-pane, I want them butted up to each other like a spreadsheet. What do I need to do to achieve this?&nbsp;</p>
<p></p><p>Thank you,</p><p>William</p>

I don't know what an option-text-pane is, but in order to control the 
gap between elements, you use the row-layout :x-gap slot which you can 
set to 0 to have no gap.  You can also set the panes' :visible-border 
slots to nil to remove their borders.
