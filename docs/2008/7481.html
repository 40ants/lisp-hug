                <pre>
Hi all,

I've run into some confusion with environment-variables in LW
Enterprise 5.0.2, running on WinXP. As an example with this minimal
startup file ...

(load-all-patches)
(setf (lw:environment-variable "HOMEDIR") "D:/")
(setf (lw:environment-variable "HOMEPATH") "/LISP/")

.... the respective environment-variables are confirmed in the Listener
after startup. But the following suggests something is amiss (perhaps with my expectation):

CL-USER 3&gt (pathname "~/test/")
#P"C:/LISP/test"

I was expecting the pathname to be prefixed with "D:", not "C:".

Try "HOMEDRIVE" instead of "HOMEDIR".

Some of the non-lisp shells I use display similar behaviour - they read the 
environment variables once at start-up and don't re-read them later.  I don't 
know, but this may be what happened here.

Maybe you want to look at hcl:change-directory and lw:current-pathname?

In order to find out when the cursor leaves a pane, I am writing a 
function which periodically compares the cursor position with the pane 
dimensions and calls a callback function if the cursor is outside.

So there is a process which is periodically invoked (as in 
scroll-test.lisp) which will find the cursor coordinates and compare 
them to the pane dimensions.

 From this process, capi:current-pointer-position is called using 
capi:apply-in-pane-process. In order to obtain the actual result of this 
call, I would like to follow the example shown in this list of using 
mp:process-wait (now there is mp:process-wait-with-timeout). When I 
attempt to do this, I receive the error "PROCESS-WAIT called when 
scheduling not allowed".

I suspect this may be because I can't nest a process-wait inside a 
function called with mp:process-run-function. Is that right or is 
something else a problem? Or is there a better way to do this?

Mitch,

I don't know the perfect answer to your question, just a quick guess:

I guess capi:apply-in-pane-process doesn't allow scheduling. So it is not a
general restriction.

I solved a similar problem using a timer. Here's a copy of the relevant
Section from my source:

(defmethod initialize-instance :after ((self toolbar2) &amp;rest initargs &amp;key
&amp;allow-other-keys)
  (setf (timer self) (mp:make-timer 'on-bar-timer self))
....

(defun ensure-hoover-off (self)
  (when (selected-button self)
    (display-tooltip (bar self) :text nil)
    (with-geometry (selected-button self)
      (gp:invalidate-rectangle (bar self) %x% %y% %width% %height%))
    (setf (selected-button self) nil)))

(defun on-bar-motion (pane x y)
  (declare (ignore y)) ;; TODO: we should check for y as well
  (let ((intf (element-interface pane)))
    ;; Set hoover item
    (let ((button (find-if (lambda (b) (and (&gt x (left b)) (&lt; x (right b))))
                           (buttons intf))))
      (if (and button (enabled button))
          (unless (and (selected-button intf)
                       (eq button (selected-button intf)))
            (ensure-hoover-off intf)
            (mp:unschedule-timer (timer intf))
            (mp:schedule-timer-relative-milliseconds (timer intf) 200 200)
            (display-tooltip (bar intf) :text nil)
            (draw-toolbar-button2 pane button :hoover t)
            (when (tooltip button)
              (display-tooltip (bar intf) :x (+ 10 (left button)) :y (+ 12
(size intf)) :text (tooltip button)))
            (setf (selected-button intf) button))
        (ensure-hoover-off intf)))))

(defun exec-bar-timer (self)
  (multiple-value-bind (x y) (current-pointer-position :relative-to (bar
self))
    (with-geometry self
      (when (or (minusp y) 
                (&gt y %height%)
                (minusp x)
                (&gt x %width%))
        (ensure-hoover-off self)
        (mp:unschedule-timer (timer self))))))

(defun on-bar-timer (self)
  (apply-in-pane-process self 'exec-bar-timer self))

(defun on-bar-destroy (self)
  (mp:unschedule-timer (timer self)))

Andreas,

Thanks for your example. Your technique of wrapping the call to 
exec-bar-timer in an apply-in-pane-process will enable me to do what I 
wanted.
