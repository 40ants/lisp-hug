Hi everybody,

I guess somewhere in the LW documentation one can find a section
explaining which syntax for key sequences a command like
EDITOR:BIND-KEY will accept, but I haven't found it yet.  It seems
that LispWorks up to 6.1 would accept something like

  (editor:bind-key "Compile Defun" #(#\control-\c #\control-\c) :mode "Lisp")

while LispWorks 7 chokes on it.  Any pointers?

Thanks,
Edi.

                 <h1>Re: Syntax for key sequences</h1>
                 <pre>Hi,

It’s something like this now: (LW6+ uses strings to describe combined keys)

  #+(and lispworks5 lw-editor)
  (bind-key "Compile and Load Buffer File"
	    #(#\control-\c #\control-\k) :mode "Lisp")

  #+(and (or lispworks6 lispworks7) lw-editor)
  (bind-key "Compile and Load Buffer File"
	    #("Control-c" "Control-k") :mode "Lisp”)

I found LW Editor manual didn’t mention this change explicitly, but all sample code in the manual has changed to use the new format [1].

Hope this helps,

Chun

&gtFrom reading the release notes, this probably has to do with the change to unicode. Check the release notes for what you need to do to specify bits now.

&gt I realize that supporting a separate Japanese/Chinese version of LW would
&gt need more effort but storing every character in 32 bits ...

Note that the user can change the default character type with
lw:set-default-character-element-type in her configuration file. See:

http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw70/LW/html/lw-684.htm#59860
http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw70/LW/html/lw-755.htm#30578
http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw70/LW/html/lw-191.htm#pgfId-890566

By default, LispWorks still use 8-bit characters (at least on Linux):

$ /usr/local/lib64/LispWorks/lispworks-7-0-0-amd64-linux -init -

CL-USER 1 &gt lw:*default-character-element-type*
BASE-CHAR

What is the recommended #+ predicate to use to detect the existence of
lw:bmp-char ? #+lispworks7 ?

&gt 
&gt It's much better to use #-(or lispworks4 lispworks5 lispworks6) so as
&gt to future-proof your code.
&gt 
&gt This is because functionality added in LispWorks 7.0 will generally
&gt also be in LispWorks 7.1, LispWorks 8.0 and all later versions.
&gt 
&gt See "Conditionalization for LispWorks versions" at
&gt 
&gt  http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw70/LW/html/lw-373.htm
&gt 
&gt 

Fixed and pushed.

Cheers,
