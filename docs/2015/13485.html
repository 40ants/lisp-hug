                <h1>Common Lisp spec question</h1>
                <pre>
Is the data in an array guaranteed to stay that way for elements beyond 
the fill pointer?

Specifically, this works in LW (and CCL):

CL-USER &gt (setf xs (make-array 5 :initial-contents '(1 2 3 4 5) 
:fill-pointer 0))
#()

CL-USER &gt (aref xs (incf (fill-pointer xs)))
2

CL-USER &gt (aref xs (incf (fill-pointer xs)))
3

CL-USER &gt (aref xs (incf (fill-pointer xs)))
4

But, I don't know if this is guaranteed in the spec.

I assume it would be true as long as the array wasn't adjusted in size. 
But I don't know if an array with a fill-pointer smaller than the 
capacity of the array means the system is allowed to resize the array 
smaller or even garbage collect objects beyond the fill pointer.

Notably, elt doesn't ignore fill pointers!
