But defining a generic code walker is not so easy.  

To give an analogy, if you try to define a generic tree walking, you
will have to provide a lot of hooks, to be able to cover all the cases,
infix, suffix, prefix, and others.  In a code walker, this is compounded
by the number of special operators.


&gt I understand that code walking is likely not publicly offered because
&gt it exceeds the charter of CLTL2 and environments were considered
&gt implementation dependent. But then so is CAPI. And I’d venture to
&gt state that we are more likely to suffer changes to the public API of

AFAIK, there are only two things that prevent to write portable code
walkers:

- when implementations define (and use) implementation specific special
  operators without providing an "equivalent" macro.  

- when implementation define extensions to standard special operators.
  This is a big no-no.  For example, one implementation allows
  CL:FUNCTION to take addionnal parameters, and of course, has some
  standard macros expand to such forms.


AFAIK, as long as implementations don't do that and provide "equivalent"
macros for all their non-standard special operators, a conforming
generic code walker can be run on them.


Now, one may have some more requirement than myself for a code walker,
namely, since we are walking code that could be run in the current
implementation, (and that is expanded assumedly from macros of the
current implementation), one may want to have accesses to the
environments of the current implementation while walking code.

This indeed may be a difficulty, but it's related to defining a portable
environment API, not to code walkers per-se.  I'd be perfectly happy
with a code walker that would provide its own environment
representations.


You may also want to have a look at the work of Robert Strandh on SICP,
involving first-class environments.
