I'm hoping that LispWorks 7.0 will include ASDF 3, as it's maybe the
last actively maintained CL implementation to only have ASDF 2. (It
would be even better if, like SBCL and MKCL, it provided UIOP
separately, and had ASDF require UIOP.)

PS: note that asdf/tools/install-asdf.lisp contains a tool to help
make (require "asdf") work in an existing LispWorks 6.1 installation.
It also contains code to install UIOP and ASDF separately.

This is certainly an opinionated point of view.  
I resisted switching to asdf for a long time myself.

But I fail to see the link between ASDF or Quicklisp and google.
Do you have any insider info, will google buy out Xach?
Also, notice that quicklisp is free software, and that you can build
your own distribution.  And Xach hosts it on Amazon clouds.

As for ASDF per-se, it has indeed the same problem as a lot of OO-based
systems, in that it is easily extensible, but only if you know well the
object model it uses, along with all its methods, so that you're able to
extend it by writing just the right method for the right subclass.

I've not dedicated the time needed to learn it enough to be able of such
a feat.

But is it really such a big problem?  It just makes it a little less
easy to extend that you would expect, but not more than other systems,
and being the third rewrite, I would expect it to rather well refined.

On the other hand, the "better" replacement should be xcvb, which IS
written by people working at ITA now Google.  The question could be
indeed, when will xcvb ready for production, and whether quicklisp would
be able to use xcvb?

I would note that if you write simple system definitions, (apart from
the fact that we usually qualify the symbol asdf:defsystem), you can
write .asd files with nothing in it really depending on asdf: it's just
a defsystem form, which _declares_ some dependencies.  How you process
this sexps is entirely up to you.

You could very well write a 20-line function to compile and load systems
using these defsystem forms, and live and be happy for ever.  (hint: use
com.informatimago.common-lisp.cesarum.file:sexp-file-contents
and com.informatimago.common-lisp.cesarum.utility:topological-sort)


For the implementation maintainers, the only thing is that asdf defines
and require some common POSIX features.  The problem here is that vendor
have not yet defined a de-facto standard (a portability library
eventually implemented by every implementation) for POSIX operation.

A long time ago I started such a POSIX API specification for CL on
sourceforge which had no traction, and you may ask Robert Strandh, how
well advanced he is with his plan to specify one POSIX function per day:
every body is busy, and until commercial vendor pay employees full time
or almost to establish such a sub-standard, nothing will advance very
fast.  Amateurs too have to pay the rent.  

Anyways, the point is that this workload ASDF requires on the part of
implementation vendors or contributors for it's integration has to be
executed in any case, be it in the other portability libraries or in the
applications.  It is a good thing for lisp developers to be able to
rely on asdf (uiop) as a portability library for those features, thanks
to ASDF ubiquity.

Madhu, I don't know what you've been smoking all this time,
but beware that abuse can trigger paranoia. I hope it's not permanent.

For the record, I am the one and only person at ITA Software then Google
who ever hacked seriously on ASDF or pushed it actively.
While many of my colleagues viewed my efforts with sympathy,
it was always viewed at best as a by-product of improving the QRes build.

Not only has Google never pushed ASDF, but it has stopped using it altogether.
What more, only one half of ITA Software was seriously using ASDF,
its airline reservation system, and Google cancelled it few years back
and the first and last customer finally pulled the plug last November.
This side project may therefore ironically one of the few lasting bits
of CL software that will have come out of the QRes adventure.

On the other hand, expect to see Lisp support appearing some time this year
for http://bazel.io/ — Google's now opensource build system.
If you want to spread FUD about Google's nefarious plans,
at least get the nefarious plans straight!

The object model was originally broken; it was only fixed with ASDF3.
If you want to understand the ASDF object model, beside the source code,
and its documentation, the best source of information is my wrap up
of my involvement as ASDF maintainer, at:
    https://github.com/fare/asdf3-2013

&gt
I fear that XCVB is mostly dead. When I became ASDF maintainer,
I stopped adding new features to XCVB. Now it lags behind in many ways,
though in other ways, it's still ahead. Yet, in these other ways,
it cannot remotely rival with bazel, Google's newly opensource build system.
Bazel implements all the things I dreamed for XCVB to implement,
except for it being an unportable java memory hog instead of
a lean portable Lisp solution. I suppose there's still an opportunity
to hack on XCVB, if someone feels like a challenge.

On the other hand, for a lean portable Lisp solution, ASDF3 is probably
a better place to start than XCVB, especially since the transition from
ASDF2 to ASDF3 was heavily informed by my experience with XCVB:
ASDF3 adopted quite a few design patterns from XCVB, not to speak about
a lot of actual code that became the start of its UIOP.
And it avoided some some dead ends that I went into during my XCVB days.
That said, more ideas from XCVB could usefully make it to ASDF, and
the asdf/TODO file describes what an ASDF4 could look like that way,
now that ASDF3 did the hard thing of fixing the ASDF object model.

&gt
For a radically simpler design that isn't backward compatible, see how
faslpath and quick-build did it. Quick-build wasn't portable, but it
was only 184 lines,
one quarter of Dan Barlow's initial hack, and 64 times less than the
current ASDF.
That said, the current ASDF contains a robust portable implementation
of the same idea, and I recommend it to all users for new developments.
See the ASDF documentation for package-inferred-system.

Yes, being able to portably (require "asdf") is great.
LispWorks 6.1 does it, but only has an antique ASDF 2 by now.

Seriously? ASDF and Quicklisp are part of some evil plot to subvert
and control a "community" of victims?

Anyone who holds that belief is welcome to bootstrap the insurrection.
IMO that is a solution without a problem.

I for one would welcome our Google overlords, if that is the price for
getting more / better tools and services widely available.

As for ASDF, I commend the creators and maintainers for the fine job
they've done over the years. I see no reason to support competing
versions of DEFSYSTEM. I am immeasurably grateful to Faré for ASDF3,
and to Xach for providing Quicklisp with hooks into ASDF. They've
helped to drag Common Lisp kicking and screaming into the 21st
century.

The alternative scenario? We could have continued to suffer with
problems the Java community solved on the 6th day of creation.

That's an interesting concept. In which context? What is the attack model?

At ITA as well as at Google, all dependencies are checked into source
control, and nothing is downloaded from the Internet.

ASDF doesn't download anything automatically by default, if that's
what you mean.

Maybe you meant a security review of Quicklisp, that does hook into
ASDF and provide auto-download magic.
But Quicklisp also can work without an internet connection.

How is ASDF more of a security issue than any build system for CL,
defsystem or not?

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#1F497D">I think this is a fairly common feeling when first starting out with any Lisp. I don’t know if you are already proficient in some other ALGOL based language,
 but that makes it worse. I felt like “Successful Lisp” was helpful for me. You can find it online at
<a href="http://psg.com/~dlamkins/sl/">http://psg.com/~dlamkins/sl/</a>. However, I think the best way to learn Lisp is to use it. I started by making a list of some common things I would want to do and just worked through them. There are many open source packages
 that make great examples. For example, I started with cl-json. I played with it until I could make it do everything that was possible. I then added clsql and continued. Eventually, the common programming patterns will come to the surface and you can start
 applying those to your own code. I tend to be a little impatient and it took some time until I could settle down and just give it the time it deserved. I hope this helps.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:#1F497D">BTW: Don’t get distracted by people talking about what is and isn’t “Lispy” code. That will come over time and through experience. You can’t expect to jump
 into a 747 and fly it like a Piper Cub. There are many, many more dials and buttons ;-)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
