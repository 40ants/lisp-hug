Hi Sarah,

I don't recall and after a quick search haven't found such a feature
but wouldn't be very surprised if it did.

What comes to mind is a thread worker pool which can be limited in
size. Libraries like pcall or eager-future2 provide and manage such a
pool, it may require a small hack to limit the pool size and then just
be sure that you use the lib for all your multiprocessing.

Cheers,
Andy

LispWorks’s multiprocessing model is based on Unix-style pthreads (and probably some equivalent on Windows). Whenever you create a new LispWorks process, it gets scheduled by the operating system.

If you have more pthreads than cores, then they have to share the cores and will interrupt each other to each get a fair share of the cores. If a process / thread needs to block, for example to make some I/O or synchronize with some other process / thread, then as long as you use the right blocking / synchronization functions, the operating system will unschedule the blocking thread and give other threads priority until the blocked thread can continue execution, to ensure that the cores are still in use.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">When you try to write concurrent programs, like a web server, you don’t need to pay too much attention otherwise, because the cores essentially give you a way to increase your throughput (more than one request can be processed at the same time).</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">If you try to write parallel programs, your goal should be to not oversubscribe the cores and create only as many threads as there are cores (or fewer, because LispWorks has background threads, and there are also other threads from other programs running on the same system).</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">There are ways to abstract from the details.

Since we've devolved to anecdotes:

1) When I build e.g. C++ systems, I do 'make -j &lt;num-cores * 2&gt'. It
generally compiles noticeably faster than 'make -j &lt;num-cores&gt' for
the systems I use. (Hyperthreading? Compiler IO?)

2) Some ancient Windows version (XP? 7?) benefited more from processor
affinity than the contemporaneous Linux versions. Linux probably was
doing a better job of keeping each thread on a given core for a longer
time, by default. I remember using a monitor tool and watching
individual threads on Windows switch between CPUs every refresh cycle.
Setting CPU affinity made a big difference on those Windows-es and
relatively little difference on those Linux-es.

I must be the only one having problems with network security programs
then, which routinely seem to take over all the processes to Œscan¹
whatever the hell it is they¹re scanning...

The issue is only about achieving something that is rarely achieved in
parallel abstractions: speeding up the classic Fibonacci function as
is, without any user hints or intervention such as creating a
single-threaded version of the function that executes after some
cutoff point (this is what lparallel is sort of doing through macros,
except the cutoff is decided by the runtime algorithm and it moves
around spontaneously). My guess is that LispWorks just doesn't switch
fast enough, possibly having to do with its model of going through
safe points, in contradistinction to SBCL which speeds up Fibonacci
quite well.

Fibonacci represents the absolute worst case scenario of a cheap
parallelizable function, and it's not at all a problem that a
particular system cannot achieve speedup in this one case. For the
vast majority of real-world uses it won't matter.

Cheers,
lmj
