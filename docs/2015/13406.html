                <h1>Optimization riddle</h1>
                <pre>
Hello everybody,

I'm stumped by the following results and I hope that someone can
explain to me what I'm missing.  This is the 64-bit version of LWW
7.0.

I have the following two functions.  (And, yes, I know there's a
better way to compute the sum of the first n integers.  This is just
an example.)

  (defun foo-1 (n)
    (loop for i from 0 to n
          sum i))

  (defun foo-2 (n)
    (declare (optimize (hcl:fixnum-safety 0) (safety 2)))
    (loop for i from 0 to n
          sum i))

If I disassemble FOO-2, I see essentially only pure machine code while
FOO-1 contains calls to functions like
SYSTEM::*%WRONG-NUMBER-OF-ARGUMENTS-STUB, SYSTEM::*%+$ANY-CODE, or
SYSTEM::*%&gt$ANY-CODE which are obviously able to cope with arbitrary
numbers and not only fixnums.  Simple-minded me expects that FOO-2
should be significantly faster.  But it's the other way around!  I
consistently get results like this:

  CL-USER 14 &gt (time (foo-1 1000000000))
  Timing the evaluation of (FOO-1 1000000000)

  User time    =        2.698
  System time  =        0.000
  Elapsed time =        2.699
  Allocation   = 50024 bytes
  0 Page faults
  500000000500000000

  CL-USER 15 &gt (time (foo-2 1000000000))
  Timing the evaluation of (FOO-2 1000000000)

  User time    =        4.461
  System time  =        0.000
  Elapsed time =        4.446
  Allocation   = 52176 bytes
  0 Page faults
  500000000500000000

What's happening?

Thanks,
Edi.

Why do they allocate?

Have you tried the, preferably new, type specifier syntax?

Interesting...

So note if you change foo-2 to optimize debug 0 and speed 2 as well as your existing declarations, it’s much faster (but still allocates). The code produced between foo-2 and this foo-3 is mostly the same, but if we look at the core of the loop we can see this:

foo-2: (the problematic code -safety 2, fixnum safety 0)

L4:   92:      4C896DF0         moveq [rbp-10], r13
      96:      4D89DC           moveq r12, r11
      99:      4C89E0           moveq rax, r12
     102:      480345F0         addq  rax, [rbp-10]
     106:      488945F8         moveq [rbp-8], rax
     110:      4C8B5DF8         moveq r11, [rbp-8]
     114:      4C896DE0         moveq [rbp-20], r13
     118:      488B45E0         moveq rax, [rbp-20]
     122:      4883C008         addq  rax, 8
     126:      488945D8         moveq [rbp-28], rax
     130:      4C8B6DD8         moveq r13, [rbp-28]
     134:      4C896DE8         moveq [rbp-18], r13
     138:      488B45E8         moveq rax, [rbp-18]
     142:      483B45D0         cmpq  rax, [rbp-30]
     146:      7FA6             jg    L1
     148:      EBC0             jmp   L3
L5

foo-3: (speed optimized - safety 2, fixnum safety 0, debug 0, speed 2)

L4:   75:      4D03DD           addq  r11, r13
      78:      4983C508         addq  r13, 8
      82:      4D3BEC           cmpq  r13, r12
      85:      7FD2             jg    L1
      87:      EBEC             jmp   L3


So the other code is doing some kind of test and indirect referencing that’s adding to the cost. Note there are no indirect references in the speed optimized version (e.g., [rbp-18]) I see some indirect references in foo-1, but not as many in the loop (though I’m only guessing L4-L6 is the loop, based on block L6 ending with the same instruction pair. (the indirect codes are using some offset to a register rather than just doing direct register arithmetic and is presumably much slower as it may require a non-cache access to memory).

foo-1: (safety 2)

L4:  113:      4D89EC           moveq r12, r13
     116:      4D89D9           moveq r9, r11
     119:      4D0BCC           orq   r9, r12
     122:      41F6C107         testb r9b, 7
     126:      7554             jne   L9
     128:      4C89D8           moveq rax, r11

     134:      488945F0         moveq [rbp-10], rax

L5:  140:      4C8B5DF0         moveq r11, [rbp-10]

     191:      EBAA             jmp   L3

So it’s possible the code generator isn’t worrying that the indirect references are slower because you didn’t ask it to optimize speed… not very intuitive I’ll admit.

My guess was that this allocation was not due to my code but rather
spurious allocation done by the IDE.  I agree that the code shouldn't
cons at all.

The point of HCL:FIXNUM-SAFETY is that you don't have to bother with
adding individual type specifiers.  Besides, I was not really trying
to optimize this function but I was experimenting with the effects of
various declarations and was surprised by this result.

Thanks for the detailed analysis.  Let me add one more thing: In my
attempt to construct an example which was as simple as possible I
forgot that in my original experiments I had already asked the
compiler to optimize for speed.  The code should have looked like this
(where FOO-3 now is your function):

(defun foo-1 (n)
  (loop for i from 0 to n
        sum i))

(defun foo-2 (n)
  (declare (optimize speed (hcl:fixnum-safety 0) (safety 2)))
  (loop for i from 0 to n
        sum i))

(defun foo-3 (n)
  (declare (optimize (speed 2) (debug 0) (hcl:fixnum-safety 0) (safety 2)))
  (loop for i from 0 to n
        sum i))

The funny thing is that even with SPEED cranked up to 3 the function
FOO-2 is still by far the slowest!  To convince the compiler to make
the code really fast, you need to tell it that you're not interested
in debuggability as in FOO-3.

I understand that there are certain dependencies between the different
optimize qualities as explained in 9.5 of the reference manual, but I
still find it counterintuitive that providing the compiler with type
information and asking it for speed will result in a significant
slow-down of the code...

See notes at the end here:

If I use sys:with-other-threads-disabled, then there's no consing.
