                <pre>
Hi,

We have just published a paper about elPrep, a tool that can be used in DNA sequencing. It is originally implemented in LispWorks, and was later also ported to SBCL to have a full open source implementation. The LispWorks version is still significantly faster and requires no manual configuration of the Lisp image to deal with the large memory requirements, as opposed to the SBCL version. The benchmark numbers reported in the paper are based on LispWorks 64-bit (version 6.1.1 in the paper, although the code has now also been ported to 7.0.0).

See http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0132868 for the paper, and https://github.com/exascience/elprep for the repository containing the open source code.

This is a web service that offers free trusted secure timestamps to anyone who wants one, by re-purposing the Bitcoin Merkel Tree hash chain. I sat down last weekend and wrote some Lisp code to take advantage of this, performing raw web POST/GET as per his instruction. He asked for permission to post my code on his website to share with others, which I do gladly. Just a small amount of code.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">Why might you want a trusted, secure, timestamp? If you are an inventor and you need to furnish proof of an idea at a certain date and time, you would hash your writeup with SHA-256 and submit it to his website to become incorporated into the Bitcoin chain. Once 5 or more Bitcoin hash blocks have extended the chain containing your hash, it becomes essentially impossible to forge, and its presence in the hash tree chain serves as legal proof of your invention on that date.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">Bela is involved, apparently, in producing automated plagiarism detection too, and time stamping serves a purpose there too. Bela’s insight in repurposing the Bitcoin hash chain removes any need for a central trusted time stamp authority, as the database is secured by the sheer number of participants all hosting a copy of the hash chain on their local computers. A very interesting social engineering platform.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">If you have any interest in modern, free (as in free beer!), and useful tools to serve the public interest, I urge you to visit his website and try it out.</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">I don’t know where or when my code will appear on his website. He asked for permission this morning. If you want a copy from me, I’ll be glad to furnish it. It’s only about 50 LOC or so… Took a few hours to write because the HTTP protocol forces you into a “20 questions” in attempting to provide the right syntax and collection of arguments. My code might save you some time fighting this perverse system.</div><div class="">&nbsp;</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class="">- DM</div><div class=""><br class=""></div><div class=""><br class=""><div><blockquote type="cite" class=""><div class="">On Jul 17, 2015, at 1:37 PM, Pascal Costanza &lt;<a href="mailto:pc@p-cos.net" class="">pc@p-cos.net</a>&gt; wrote:</div><br class="Apple-interchange-newline"><div class=""><br class="">Hi,<br class=""><br class="">We have just published a paper about elPrep, a tool that can be used in DNA sequencing.

  Interesting... I can see another application, if you allow this
  off-topic digression. Music composers could submit the hash of, e.g.,
  a MusicXML score to ensure original intellectual property of their
  artwork...
