                <h1>Difficulty understanding pipe-exist-status documentation</h1>
                <pre>
Hi,

I’m having some difficulty understanding the documentation for pipe-exit-status, which is new in LispWorks 7.0.

The documentation states:

"If wait is t then pipe-exit-status waits until the child process dies. If wait is nil then pipe-exit-status does not wait, and if the child process is still running it returns nil. The default value of wait is t.

On Microsoft Windows, if close was called on the stream before the child process died, then pipe-exit-status returns exit-status :closed. On Unix-like systems it works after close but for compatibility it should be called only before calling close.”

Does the second paragraph about behavior specific to Microsoft Windows apply both when wait is t or nil, or only when wait is nil?

If it applies also when wait is t, how do I properly close a program and wait for it to die?

The use case is an external program with a pipe that accepts input from LispWorks, but only finishes executing when that stream is closed. However, the external program may lag behind, so it’s really important that I wait until that program finishes before proceeding. In Unix, I would expect to be able to just call close and then pipe-exit-status with :wait t on the stream, but the documentation makes me doubt that’s portable. Unfortunately, I can’t test this for Windows since I don’t have a LispWorks license for Windows.

Thanks a lot for comments in advance,
Pascal

Hi Pascal,

The second paragraph applies regardless of the value of wait.

There is no way to close the stream gracefully and wait for the process to
finish.

If the child process has a "quit" command, then you could send that down the
pipe.

Otherwise, you can use system:pipe-kill-process to force it to die
(http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw70/LW/html/lw-1319.htm).

I.e. this sequence of calls should work:

(setq pipe (sys:open-pipe ... :save-exit-status t))
(system:pipe-kill-process pipe)
(system:pipe-exit-status pipe :wait t)
(close pipe)

That may not help in your case though if you want the program to exit
gracefully.  We possibly need to add a function that causes eof in the program
(i.e. closes the pipe handles in the stream) without closing the whole stream
so that it can still be queried by pipe-exist-status.

Hi Martin,

Thanks a lot for the answer. For now, calling pipe-exit-status after close seems to work at least in Linux, which is our main target platform. The external process is third-party software which doesn’t have a quit command and will most likely not do what we want if we just kill it. So yes, some additional functionality in LispWorks to gracefully close the handles would be good, although it’s not urgent for our particular case.

Thanks,
Pascal
