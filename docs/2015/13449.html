                <h1>Sum Types?</h1>
                <pre>
I find myself wishing for a Sum-type, a la ML? What I found is, for example, where I need something like a Point over an Elliptic Curve on a Galois field, it has an X-coordinate and a Y-coordinate, unless it is the point at infinity. So in ML I would write something like:

type Pt = (Integer, Integer) | Infinity.

In Lisp, I define methods on the x-y points, and EQL methods for the case of infinity. But what I also find is that doing so causes a huge slowdown, almost a factor of 2x compared to an encoding where some distinguished value for x, e.g., x = 0, is used to represent the point at infinity.

(defstruct pt
	x y)

(defmethod pt-double ((a pt))
	….)

(defmethod pt-double ((a (eql :inf)))
	:inf)

I know in the back of my mind that ML grew out of Lisp back in the early days. How did they encode Sum types in the early ML?

I think the normal correspondence between ML sum types and OO is
something like the following. Not specific to CL:

datatype Pt =
    pt(x : int, y : int)
  | infinity

double pt(x,y) = pt(x+x,y+y)
double infinity = infinity

&lt;==&gt

(defclass pt ())                      ; an "abstract" class
(defclass pt-2ints (pt) (x y))  ; n subclasses implementing n disjoint
branches of the sum
(defclass pt-inf (pt))              ; ...

(defmethod pt-double (p pt-2ints)
    ...)
(defmethod pt-double (p pt-inf)
    p)

I don't know though if this is faster than the EQL method (my feeling
is that it should be faster, but no guarantee)

Cheers
P.
