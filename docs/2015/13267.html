                <h1>Scoped reader macros</h1>
                <pre>
Hi,

Is it possible to create local reader macros?

For example

(with-special-syntax
  (setf a[0] b))

=&gt (setf (aref a 0) b)


I came across this file: https://github.com/scketches/lisp/blob/master/read-table-dispatch.lisp

However I'm curios to whether it is possible to achieve the same effect *without* using another macro character!

Regards
Erik

Yes. But only by writing a global reader macro.


&gt For example
&gt
&gt (with-special-syntax
&gt   (setf a[0] b))
&gt
&gt =&gt (setf (aref a 0) b)

No, it's not, in general.

In this specific case: (with-special-syntax (setf a[0] b))
you could play tricks with a normal macro, because a[0] is a normal
symbol.  Therefore with-special-syntax could be a macro incorporating a
code walker, that would substitute symbols whose names have the required
syntax by some sexp.  But this would be rather untasty, and overly
complex, once you start wanting to deal with cases such as:


    (with-special-syntax (setf a[(+ 1 b[(- i 1)])] c))


We're dealing with a sexp:

      (setf a[ 
            (+ 1
               b[
               (- i 
                  1)
               ])
            ]
            c)

containing the following symbols: (setf a[ + 1 b[ - i ] c) and your
macro would have to parse back this sexp into your "infix" source and
then translate it into a lisp form.

Hi,

It’s some time ago that I looked into this, but what I remember is that s-expression-local reader macros are problematic and probably not reliable enough.

However, I have had very good experiences with named-readtables, a library you can find in quicklisp. This allows you to define file-local reader macros, which may be good enough for your purposes.

Another possibility is to install a reader macro for #\( that checks
if the first symbol is e.g. with-readtable or with-named-readtable and
process the form itself in such case.

Hello Erik.


PS: I'm replying to the list, I hope you don't mind.


I thought so too at first glance.

But the implementation of this idea is full of subtleties and problems
to solve.  The first is that you don't know if the form is supposed to
be a literal form, e.g:

    (defvar my-symbols '(with-named-readtable foo bar))

How would this macro character know if it should handle the quoted
form?  You'd probably have to install more reader macros for every
literal syntax, such as #\' (quote), #\# (sharpsign) and #\`
(backquote).  Worse, you'd have to identify pre-emptively where forms
are expected.

Supposing you solve this problem, the implementation would have to
keep the thus far read characters themselves in case it wants to
(perhaps conditionally) chain to the previously installed #\( reader
macro function, e.g. by means of make-string-input-stream with a
string of the thus far read characters, and make-concatenated-stream
with this string input stream and the actual stream.


Both Pascals have resumed their experience in their answers, perhaps a
bit too much, such that their points are a bit opaque to people with
less reader macro experience without these gory^W expository details.
They are right though, you can't achieve this without at least one
other reader macro, because that's the level where you'd have to
handle this, or that file-local named readtables are quite enough,
such that you'd simply split your code in multiple files in case a
piece of code requires the standard readtable and another piece of
code requires a named readtable (for instance).


An alternative that would fit better with the reader algorithm and
syntax would be to use a dispatch macro character, such as e.g.
#n(:named-readtable)... that would temporarily bind *readtable* to a
named readtable and use a recursive read.  It puts the burden on the
user (the consuming programmer), where the use of #n is explicit about
the intention to use another readtable, no matter if inside a quoted
or literal form.


Best regards,

Paulo Madeira

&gt Wow, that's clever!
&gt
&gt Still, it assumes no other package is also installs a reader macro for #\( (?) On the other hand, that is probably not very likely.

&gt&gt&gt&gt Hi,
&gt&gt&gt&gt
&gt&gt&gt&gt It’s some time ago that I looked into this, but what I remember is that s-expression-local reader macros are problematic and probably not reliable enough.
&gt&gt&gt&gt
&gt&gt&gt&gt However, I have had very good experiences with named-readtables, a library you can find in quicklisp. This allows you to define file-local reader macros, which may be good enough for your purposes.

&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt Hi,
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt Is it possible to create local reader macros?
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt For example
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt (with-special-syntax
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt (setf a[0] b))
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt =&gt (setf (aref a 0) b)
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt I came across this file: https://github.com/scketches/lisp/blob/master/read-table-dispatch.lisp
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt However I'm curios to whether it is possible to achieve the same effect *without* using another macro character!
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt Regards
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt Erik
