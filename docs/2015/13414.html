                <h1>Abbreviated completion in LW7</h1>
                <pre>
Hi everybody,

in LW6, if I type

  (do

in a listener window and then press Alt-I, I get a list of symbols
starting with "DO" to choose from, "DOLIST", "DOTIMES", etc.  If I
instead type

  (d-o

and press Alt-I I, I get "DESCRIBE-OBJECT" immediately.

In LW7, if I type

  (do

and press Alt-I, the symbol is immediately completed to "DESCRIBE-OBJECT".

I couldn't find a mention of this change in the release notes and I
have to say I don't like the new behavior.  Is there a way to switch
back to the old behavior?  (From a quick glance at the editor sources
my guess would be that this could be due to the change from
LW::ABBREVIATED-FIND-SYMBOLS to
COMMON-UTILITIES::ABBREVIATED-FIND-SYMBOLS and the old function is no
longer there...)

Thanks,
Edi.

Moin Edi,

Doesn't Ctrl-Alt-I do what you want?

Moin Arthur,

No, because it can't complete "(d-o" like the "old" Alt-I could.

Thanks,
Edi.
