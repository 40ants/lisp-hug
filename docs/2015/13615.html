There should be no difference, and no error generated.

Are you sure lispworks generates the error you're saying, when you
evaluate either of those forms?

Try with (cl:lambda () cl:nil) 


The specification of compile is clear, the definition can be a lambda
expression or a function. In your case, it's a function (as returned by
(lambda () nil), and it doesn't matter whether it's a lexical closure,
an interpreted function or a compiled function.  Compile should return
an equivalent compiled function.

I interpret the undefined consequences about whether the returned
closure shares or not the enclosed environment:

    (let ((x 42))
         (let ((f (compile nil (lambda () x))))
           (list (funcall f)
                 (setf x 0)
                 (funcall f))))
    --&gt (42 0 0) 
    ;; or:
    --&gt (42 0 42)

One could also interpret it as saying that if you're trying to compile
a closure, then you might get an error or an invalid function, but this
would be the sign of a low-quality implementation, and that would
motivate its rejection, and definitely not worth of a commercial
implementation.

That said, CMUCL has the same failing, when the function is really a
closure:

Clozure Common Lisp            --&gt (42 0 0)
CLISP                          --&gt (42 0 0)
CMU Common Lisp                 Error in function
                                 C::GET-LAMBDA-TO-COMPILE:    
                                 #&lt;Interpreted Function "LET ((X 42))"
                                 {581A0871}&gt was defined in a non-null
                                 environment.
SBCL                           --&gt (42 0 0)

For (lambda () nil) it compiles it as expected.

You're not compiling a lambda expression here, though, so that
coercion doesn't matter.  You'd have to be doing

    (compile nil '(lambda () nil))

to be compiling a lambda expression.  You're passing a closure object
as the second argument to compile. I think it's a bit strange that

! The consequences are undefined if the lexical environment
! surrounding the function to be compiled contains any bindings
! other than those for macros, symbol macros, or declarations.

would come into play here, but the evaluation of `(lambda () nil)`
would have closed over whatever the lexical environment available in
the REPL is; so maybe that's relevant?  For what it's worth, when you
actually pass a lambda expression, there's no issue:

    (funcall (lambda () (compile nil '(lambda () nil))))

I've run into this sort of thing before but there were lexical
bindings in my case; I believe the problem to be that without the
quote around the inner lambda, that lambda is evaluated to produce an
interpreted function, and because it is within a lexical context (the
outer lambda) it is considered a lexical closure albeit with zero
bindings.

Because of the differences in lexical environment implementation
between compiled and interpreted contexts, the compiler throws this
error. If that's the case, perhaps LW could be improved to recognise
when the lexical environment is empty and proceed without error.

That seems acceptable to me, given that there are a lot of other places
where you can also obtain separate closures.  For example in loops.

That wouldn't be worse than what you'd get with a lambda expression.
It would be a way to get automatically the equivalent of:

    (funcall (let ((x 42)) (eval `(let ((x ,x)) (lambda () x)))))
    --&gt 42

    (funcall (let ((x 42)) (compile nil (lambda () x))))
    --&gt 42

&gt compile all other functions which shared the
&gt environment (not really OK, if it can even find them) or have some
&gt heroic special case.  I certainly would be fine with a system which
&gt did none of these and threw an error since I can't see this ever being
&gt useful.

Now, other implementations don't go as far, but at least they
distinguish functions that have no free variables.  This case should be
handled properly.  (And users can always use the EVAL above instead of
COMPILE when they have free variables).

The specification for COERCE says: "If object is already of type result-type,
the object itself is returned..." so that matches your case.

&gt One could also interpret it as saying that if you're trying to compile

&gt 
&gt I think the point was that a system might well have a different representation for lexical environments in compiled and interpreted code (and probably always does in fact) making compiling a function defined in a non-null environment at best painful  since it would either have to break the semantics of the program by splitting the environments (never OK), compile all other functions which shared the environment (not really OK, if it can even find them) or have some heroic special case.  I certainly would be fine with a system which did none of these and threw an error since I can't see this ever being useful.
