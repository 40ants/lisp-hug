There's nothing in the CLHS that prevents structures to be implemented 
as CLOS classes either.

But it is not conforming, for a program to depend on it.
This CL-SDL2 library is not conforming!  It should not have been called 
CL- something!

The only way to create a structure is to call one of the structure 
constructors (or one of the structure copiers), that can be declared in 
the defstruct structure options; by default, it's MAKE-FOO for a 
structure named FOO.


Now, you have basically two choices:

- either make the code conforming by replacing the calls to 
make-instance to calls to make-foo; but there may have other places 
where they have taken advantage of structures as CLOS objects; notably, 
the structure accessors are not (necessarily) generic functions! So you 
may prefer to:

- implement a DEFSTRUCT macro that will define CLOS classes instead, and 
shadow CL:DEFSTRUCT, to use it instead. Depending on how packages are 
used by the source base, this may be more or less work, and it is also 
indiscriminate since it would apply to all the structures defined in 
those packages, but it may be preferable to do that.  Notice that 
DEFSTRUCT is not a trivial macro (it defines a lot of functions, 
computing a lot of names, and you must be careful with case, and 
packages where those symbols are interned), and there's a big stubbling 
block: :INCLUDE may refer structures that have not been defined with 
your DEFSTRUCT macro (and therefore that are NOT CLOS classes).  I guess 
you can fall back to CL:DEFSTRUCT if there's an :INCLUDE referencing a 
structure you don't know and have generated as a DEFCLASS.

See 
http://informatimago.com/articles/usenet.html#Improved-DEFSTRUCT-macro--run-time-access-to-the-fields 
for a few examples, notably DEFINE-STRUCTURE-CLASS in the 
DEFINE-WITH-STRUCTURE 
&lt;http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.lisp/msg/f687db3424753775&gt page.


Probably, making the code conforming would be the simpliest option, even 
if it could be laborious on a big code base.

Note that this can be *conditionally* implemented.  You can retain code
that uses MAKE-INSTANCE on structure classes for those implementations
that you know to support it.

I don't know who wrote this, or what their motivations were, but
replacing all structures with CLOS objects *might* have an adverse
effect on the efficiency of the code, so you might not want to replace
structures with classes.

Note also that you might not have to replace calls to MAKE-INSTANCE with
calls to make-foo -- the MOP says MAKE-INSTANCE is a generic function,
so you could add EQL methods for the (names of) the structure classes
you need, again, conditionally compiling for those lisps that need them.

The accessors might be more of a nuisance, and require some macrology,
but this would depend on whether you really rely on them being treated
as GFs.  If someone's fussed about efficiency, my guess is that they
would be using the accessors in ways that are consistent with them not
being GFs.

Indeed. I was about to propose a third solution consisting in having a
CLOS wrapper over structures, but this opens three more cans of worms,
so really, the library should be rewritten in conforming CL code instead
of sbclese.

Just out of curiosity I looked for but couldn't find an occurrence of
make-instance in https://github.com/lispgames/cl-sdl2, does it occur
in some other code using that library?
