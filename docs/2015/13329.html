Hi Mark,

What about creating a subclass for your component and act on instances of that class. You could register callbacks functions to be notified about specific events.

Don’t forget that events in the CAPI happen in a specific process, therefore you need to take care of that aspect using (for example) mailboxes, if you don’t want to corrupt your state.

Best,
Cam

&gt If I write a function to return a pane to be used as part of a larger window in CAPI - for example:
&gt 
&gt (defun stat-pane (data) ()
