                <h1>deliverying an executable with foreign object files included</h1>
                <pre>List,

Is it possible to deliver an executable which would "contain" (and
make use of functions defined in) a compiled object (i.e. "foo.o") or
code from a static library (i.e. "libfoo.a"). The assumption here is
that we do not own either the source that allows the generation of
foo.o or libfoo.a, yet we want to use (fli:define-foreign-functions)
functions within this object.


Thank you.

                 <pre>You can link to any shared object. Look at manardb which uses a couple of libs.

                 <pre>I do not have the shared objects, just the relocatable objects.

                 <pre>You can build a shared object from this relocatable objects,by
exporting necessary functions in this relocatable objects to the
shared object.
