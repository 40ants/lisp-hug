                <h1>inconsistent results with FLI:PRINT-COLLECTED-TEMPLATE-INFO</h1>
                <pre>I'm attempting to deliver a shared library for another application (Mac, 64bit).  I deliver it at level 0, 
call FLI:START-COLLECTING-TEMPLATE-INFO, test all the entry points, and then call FLI:PRINT-COLLECTED-TEMPLATE-INFO. Sometimes it works and other times I get no output (and no errors). 

Next problem, I added a new call with a different foreign type. It gave some templates for this new foreign type, but dropped all of the previous ones that had been generated with other calls (every entry point was included in the test).

Any ideas or suggestions?

                 <pre>Shot in the dark: maybe you need to call #'finish-output to ensure that buffers are flushed before the process ends?

                 <pre>Good thought, but I double checked what was being written by returning the output from FLI:PRINT-COLLECTED-TEMPLATE-INFO to the program that called it.

                 <pre>Solved: When I was building the debug version of the library to test and collect the template information, I was including the templates. This causes nothing to be generated or only new types that were not in the last set. I just needed to adjust the build file to exclude the generated templates file when delivering at level 0.
