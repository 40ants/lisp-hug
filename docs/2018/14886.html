                <h1>Time-editing</h1>
                <pre>I have an employee time clock application, and I’d like it to have a user-friendly way to request corrections in cases where people fail to clock in or out at the correct time. Apple’s Calendar program (we’re on Macs) offers a good example of what works for editing times.

I’ve tried cobbling together row layouts with text-edit-panes, and that looks like a dead end. Output-panes would be my next choice, but I thought I’d ask first to see if this is a problem that someone’s already solved in LispWorks.

Thanks as always for your help.

LW

                 <pre>I have no idea if this still works and if it is what you had in mind,
but maybe the time and date widgets here can help:

                 <pre>Thanks, Edi. This looks like it’s either going to be usable code or at least a good track to follow.

I can offer a kind of calendar mentioned bellow

The code is rather old ans has not been ported to the latest LW version yet.
