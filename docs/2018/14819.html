                <h1>installing mgl-pax error</h1>
                <pre>I am installing the "mgl-pax" project with quicklisp, and it can not be 
done. But the package can be installed successfully with SBCL.

I guess that the errors are cause by the failing load of 
"pythonic-string-reader", because some errors info means that some 
pythonic comment is treated as code.

I do not know how to fix it, is there any seggestion?

Thank you.

The error info is too long.&nbsp; The following are some lines.
