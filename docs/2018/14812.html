                 <pre>I'd assume that (assuming the forms are at toplevel) they would get processed with the normal semantics during compilation and loading of the files, but not either during delivery or during later running of the delivered application (obviously LW people would know this better!).

When I delivered applications (which was, OK, long ago now) I wrote a framework which let you define hooks which got run by the initial function when the application started (in fact the initial function was just a standard thing that processed the command line &amp; ran various hooks and then called whatever you really wanted to happen).  Things in those hooks did the equivalent of what I'd do with (eval-when (... :load-toplevel) ...), although there was a more elaborate notion of times things could run.
