                <h1>NSSpeechRecognizer commands</h1>
                <pre>I am trying to set a list of commands for the MacOS NSSpeechRecognizer class (Objective-C/Cocoa) without success. 

Here is some of the code I am using:

(objc:ensure-objc-initialized
  :modules
  '("/System/Library/Frameworks/Carbon.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/SpeechRecognition.framework/Versions/A/SpeechRecognition"))

(defparameter *Speech-Recognizer*
 (objc:alloc-init-object "NSSpeechRecognizer"))

(objc:description *Speech-Recognizer*)  —&gt  "&lt;NSSpeechRecognizer: 0x10290b880&gt"

So far so good. 

The Apple documentation says that NSSpeechRecognizer  has a “commands" variable with the following signature. 
var commands: [String]? { get set }

Unfortunately, the objc:objc-object-var-value method does not allow to set or get this value. 
Because as its documentation says: "Note that it is only possible to access instance variables that are defined in Lisp by define-objc-class, not those inherited from superclasses implemented in Objective-C.”

Interestingly, it appears that there is a “commands” method that can be invoked on an NSSpeechRecognizer instance.  

(objc:can-invoke-p *Speech-Recognizer* "commands”) —&gt T

(objc:invoke *Speech-Recognizer* “commands”)
returns a null pointer, which would make sense given that there is no list of commands yet. 

This is where I am stuck. How could I add to the list of commands ?

                 <pre>Hi,

IIRC there is no compile-time checks on if method is implemented by the
class, as calling Obj-C method is a way to "send a message" to the
class, and Obj-C may define runtime ways to determine what to do if the
method is not found.

&gt&gt Hopefully, someone who DOES know what they are doing will reply with a more
&gt&gt useful answer.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt I think that LispWorks produces DLLs that are compatible with C Language
&gt&gt access. And LispWorks can access DLLs compiled by a C compiler. So, DLLs go
&gt&gt both ways, Lisp calls to DLL functions and C calls to DLL functions.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt So in my thinking, what you want to do involves learning the "LispWorks
&gt&gt Delivery User Guide", particularly at these links:
&gt&gt http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw71/DV/html/delivery-130.htm
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw60/LW/html/lw-200.htm#pgfId-885976
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt and maybe this as well for Foreign Language Interface
&gt&gt http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw60/FLI/html/fli.htm
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt I have perused a little but not actually tried interfacing with C.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt I think the LispWorks compiler can compile a C Language program if the file
&gt&gt ends with ".c" . This is Windows. You are doing Mac. So, maybe you designate a
&gt&gt C source file differently.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt I tried to compile a file named "try.c" with contents
&gt&gt void f (void) {}
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt I loaded the file into LispWorks. Clicked the Compile Buffer button. The
&gt&gt output looked to me that LispWorks was doing a C Language compile by
&gt&gt automatically calling a C compiler that I had installed. LispWorks was not
&gt&gt doing a Lisp source code compilation.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt My test did not compile because "Error: the variable 'void' is unbound. So,
&gt&gt for sure I am not doing something right.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt Still, what I have said maybe could lead you to find the answer for what you
&gt&gt are trying to do. If so, I hope you will share what you figure out on this C
&gt&gt and Lisp interfacing because I anticipate going there at some point.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt Or, maybe you have already been to the links I suggested and it is not
&gt&gt helpful.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt Hopefully, someone who knows what they are doing will respond. I am trying to
&gt&gt post in the spirit of Lisp HUG members trying to help each other. I know I
&gt&gt have been helped fantastically several times in Lisp HUG.

                 <pre>Understood. 

But even if there was a check at compile time, you would still be in a trial-and-error mode to figure out which string to use for the call (message to send). 

In this respect, the Lispworks Java Interface is really well done.  
A call to lw-ji:import-java-class-definitions with the class name as a string argument returns the list of all callable methods.

&gt&gt Hi Ron, 
&gt&gt thanks for your quick response, unfortunately it is not helping. 
&gt&gt The kind of issue you are having is quite different than mine. 
&gt&gt It has noting to do with application delivery, and only remotely with Foreign Language Interface. 
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt LispWorks has specific functions and methods to use Objective-C and Cocoa on MacOS. 
&gt&gt http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw60/OBJC/html/objc.htm
&gt&gt I was trying to figure out some method names I want to call. 
&gt&gt Some methods can be easily identified from the Apple documentation (ex. “setCommands:" from my previous message). 
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt Others are more difficult like  "startSpeaking(_:)”.
&gt&gt After many trial-and-errors, I finally figured that one out as well. 
&gt&gt (objc:can-invoke-p *ss* "startSpeakingString:")
&gt&gt T

&gt&gt&gt I have NOT done this and don't really know what I am doing. Still, maybe what I say could help figure out how to do what you want to do.
&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt Hopefully, someone who DOES know what they are doing will reply with a more useful answer.
&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt I think that LispWorks produces DLLs that are compatible with C Language access. And LispWorks can access DLLs compiled by a C compiler. So, DLLs go both ways, Lisp calls to DLL functions and C calls to DLL functions.
&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt So in my thinking, what you want to do involves learning the "LispWorks Delivery User Guide", particularly at these links:
&gt&gt&gt http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw71/DV/html/delivery-130.htm
&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw60/LW/html/lw-200.htm#pgfId-885976
&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt and maybe this as well for Foreign Language Interface
&gt&gt&gt http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw60/FLI/html/fli.htm
&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt I have perused a little but not actually tried interfacing with C. 
&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt I think the LispWorks compiler can compile a C Language program if the file ends with ".c" . This is Windows. You are doing Mac. So, maybe you designate a C source file differently.
&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt I tried to compile a file named "try.c" with contents
&gt&gt&gt void f (void) {}
&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt I loaded the file into LispWorks. Clicked the Compile Buffer button. The output looked to me that LispWorks was doing a C Language compile by automatically calling a C compiler that I had installed. LispWorks was not doing a Lisp source code compilation.
&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt My test did not compile because "Error: the variable 'void' is unbound. So, for sure I am not doing something right.
&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt Still, what I have said maybe could lead you to find the answer for what you are trying to do. If so, I hope you will share what you figure out on this C and Lisp interfacing because I anticipate going there at some point.
&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt Or, maybe you have already been to the links I suggested and it is not helpful.
&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt Hopefully, someone who knows what they are doing will respond. I am trying to post in the spirit of Lisp HUG members trying to help each other. I know I have been helped fantastically several times in Lisp HUG.

&gt&gt&gt Subject: Re: NSSpeechRecognizer commands
&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt I am just wondering. 
&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt Is there a way to inspect the list of available Objective-C methods for a class? 
&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt Calling objc:can-invoke-p on a trial and error basis is not very optional. 
&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt I am looking specifically to know what would be the method name for
&gt&gt&gt startSpeaking(_:)

&gt&gt&gt Thanks.

&gt&gt&gt&gt Sorry for the noise. 
&gt&gt&gt&gt I just found the solution:
&gt&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt&gt (objc:invoke *Speech-Recognizer* "setCommands:" (vector "Hello”))

&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt I am trying to set a list of commands for the MacOS NSSpeechRecognizer class (Objective-C/Cocoa) without success. 
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt Here is some of the code I am using:
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt (objc:ensure-objc-initialized
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt :modules
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt '("/System/Library/Frameworks/Carbon.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt SpeechRecognition.framework/Versions/A/SpeechRecognition"))
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt (defparameter *Speech-Recognizer*
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt (objc:alloc-init-object "NSSpeechRecognizer"))
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt (objc:description *Speech-Recognizer*)  —&gt  "&lt;NSSpeechRecognizer: 0x10290b880&gt"
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt So far so good. 
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt The Apple documentation says that NSSpeechRecognizer  has a “commands" variable with the following signature. 
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt var commands: [String]? { get set }
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt Unfortunately, the objc:objc-object-var-value method does not allow to set or get this value. 
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt Because as its documentation says: "Note that it is only possible to access instance variables that are defined in Lisp by define-objc-class, not those inherited from superclasses implemented in Objective-C.”
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt Interestingly, it appears that there is a “commands” method that can be invoked on an NSSpeechRecognizer instance.  
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt (objc:can-invoke-p *Speech-Recognizer* "commands”) —&gt T
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt (objc:invoke *Speech-Recognizer* “commands”) returns a null pointer, 
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt which would make sense given that there is no list of commands yet.
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt 
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt This is where I am stuck. How could I add to the list of commands ?
&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt
