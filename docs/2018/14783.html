                <h1>Question about macro expansion</h1>
                <pre>Suppose that in package my-macros, I have:

(defmacro foo (bar p v)
  `(defun ,bar ()
     (if (func ,p)
       ,v)))

If I expand the macro in my-package-1, e.g.

(foo a 'b 'c)

it becomes

(defun a ()
  (if (my-macros:func 'b)
    'c)

But "func" doesn't exist in the my-macros package.  It does exist in my-package-1 (and my-package-2, ...)

Why is a macro assuming the package of a function?  More importantly, can I define a macro once such that when it is expanded in my-package-N it calls the func in my-packageN?  Right now, I'm defining the same macro in each package where it's used so that I can get the behavior I need, but surely there's a better way.

When the reader encounters a hitherto unknown symbol without an explicit package qualifier, it assumes the symbol belongs to the current package. You can tell the reader that FUNC belongs to some other package by either explicitly qualifying the symbol—that is, by writing THE-OTHER-PACKAGE:FUNC— or by importing the symbol FUNC from the other package into package MY-MACROS.

Please note, the reader doesn’t “assume the package of a function”. Functions don’t have packages. Only symbols have packages. Packages contain symbols, and only symbols.

                 <pre>Right.  But in this case I'm emitting code to be compiled in multiple packages. At compile time, I want the "func" which is defined in the package in which the macro is expanded.  Not the package in which the macro is defined.

It’s the reader, not the macroexpander, that decides which package you’re referring to. If your macroexpander refers to the symbol FUNC, then the reader looks for it in the package that is the value of CL:*PACKAGE* at the time the macro definition is processed. If you want FUNC to be found in some other package then you must explicitly arrange for it to be looked up in that other package. 

There are various ways to accomplish that. If your requirements can’t be met by explicitly qualifying the symbol, or by suitable choice of in-package or let-binding CL:*PACKAGE*, then you could do something like

(funcall (intern “FUNC” (choose-the-correct-package-for-the-context)
            ,p))

                 <pre>Chris, cjv, and mikel:

Madhu provided a suggestion that is a synthesis of your solutions.  I didn't want to provide "func" as a parameter to the macros, because it's the same in every case, and I'd like to save typing.  And, yes, "func" is defined in each file that uses foo.

Madhu's suggestion was to define foo as follows:

  (defmacro foo (bar p v &amp;optional (func (intern "FUNC" *package*)))
    ...
    (if (,func ...


Thanks, everyone.

And, yes, I'm not happy with a design that needs this, but I'm still trying to shape things.

                 <pre>&amp;aux is also an option for that hack.&nbsp; &amp;optional allows users to specify 
a name. &amp;aux doesn't&nbsp; change the API of the macro. I personally would go 
for &amp;optional because I think func should be a parameter.

<p dir="auto">Yes, it would help if you were to explain why you want the macro to get a <em>different</em> function in every package where it is used, instead of importing the <code style="background-color:#F7F7F7; border-radius:3px; margin:0; padding:0 0.4em" bgcolor="#F7F7F7">func</code> symbol into every package where you use your macro.</p>

Madhu provided a suggestion that is a synthesis of your solutions.  I didn't want to provide "func" as a parameter to the macros, because it's the same in every case, and I'd like to save typing.  And, yes, "func" is defined in each file that uses foo.<br class="">

Madhu's suggestion was to define foo as follows:<br class="">
<br class="">
  (defmacro foo (bar p v &amp;optional (func (intern "FUNC" *package*)))<br class="">

    (if (,func ...<br class="">

Had you made FUNC a parameter of the macro, e.g., (foo func ...), then the macro would be more flexible and you wouldn't have this problem.<br class="">
