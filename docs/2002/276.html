                <h1>Displaying Unicode characters in Listener and Editor</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

I'm running LWW 4.2 on Windows 98.

From time to time I work with strings containing characters
beyond the Latin-1 range (with character codes &gt= 256).
Unfortunately, those characters are always displayed as 
question marks, even when I select a font (like Lucide Console) 
that can perfectly well display those characters.

In older versions of Lispworks (I'm not sure about 4.1, but I
definitely remember doing this in 4.0.x) this used to work perfectly.

Does anybody have any suggestions for how I can get this to work again?

Thanks a lot,

Arthur Lemmens

&gt 
&gt In LWW 4.0.1 and 4.1, we used the Win32 Unicode API TextOutW which
&gt displays all Unicode characters.
&gt 
&gt However we found it to be broken with certain fonts on Chinese Windows
&gt 95 and therefore from LWW4.1.17 onwards we've used TextOutA on Windows
&gt 95/98/ME. Unicode display is still OK the Windows NT platforms, but on
&gt Windows 95/98/ME, LWW displays characters in the current code page
&gt only. (This applies to capi:list-panel and capi:editor-pane at least;
&gt it's possible that other classes may still do Unicode display.)
&gt 
&gt We'd be happy to investigate using the 'W' API again. It's the sort of
&gt thing that would constitute a chargeable support call.

How about Linux?  Should it somehow be possible to display Unicode
characters (using a Unicode font)?  I tried several times, but lost...
