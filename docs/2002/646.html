                <h1>Using the podium echo area</h1>
                <pre>I'd like to be able to print little `progress' type messages in the LW
development environment - for instance, various things happen (or
don't happen) when our LW development image starts up, such as CORBA
things starting, and it would be nice to have a little non-intrusive
way of indicating this (so *not* a dialog box!).  The little echo area
in the LW podium would seem ideal for this (and some LW things seem
already to use it for this, I think), but I can't find out how to
drive it or if doing so is safe.  Does anyone know how to do this?

(Someone is now going to point me at the exported, documented,
interface to do this and I'll feel like a fool...)

Thanks

                  <pre>Hello,

|    I'd like to be able to print little `progress' type messages in the
| LW
|    development environment - for instance, various things happen (or
|    don't happen) when our LW development image starts up, such as CORBA
|    things starting, and it would be nice to have a little non-intrusive
|    way of indicating this (so *not* a dialog box!).  The little echo
| area
|    in the LW podium would seem ideal for this (and some LW things seem
|    already to use it for this, I think), but I can't find out how to

| The echo areas in the LispWorks IDE are really for feedback on
| user-input. So you might want to consider creating your own
| non-intrusive window.
|...snip...|
| You'd need something different on Windows, where the Podium window
| does not have an echo area, which is another reason to create your own
| window for messages.

On LWW, I suggest something like this:

(defun update-podium-meter (n)
  (let ((podium (capi:locate-interface 'lw-tools::lispworks-podium)))
    (setf (capi:titled-pane-message podium)
           (format nil "Something in progress ~v@{~c~:*~:}" n
#\Rubout))))

Naturally, you could try another character instead of Rubout rendered as
a small black rectangle.
