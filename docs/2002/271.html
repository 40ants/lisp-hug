                <h1>LWW vs. wheely-mouse</h1>
                <pre>Under Windws 2000, LWW 4.2, the wheel on my microsoft mouse does not 
work.  I can live without it, but if anybody knows how to enable it, I'd be 
interested.

BTW: in a previous email I asked and got answers on how to make spacebar 
the Complete Input function.  I found that there is a minor drawback to 
doing this - now, I can't specify a space when I use the Replace String 
interactive function.

thanx

This is not ideal, but here's something the Xanalys support team told
me about a year or so ago:

There's a thing called MouseWheel available at
http://www.microsoft.com/msj/defaultframe.asp?page=/msj/0697/hood0697.htm&amp;nav=/msj/0697/newnav.htm

The file you want is called Hood0697.exe.

It works by intercepting the wheel messages and turning them into
scroll messages.

You have to tell it about every application for which you want it to
intercept the wheel messages, so if you are producing delivered
applications from LW, you need to tell MouseWheel about those as well
as telling it about LW itself. If you are passing on delivered apps
to other people, those people will need MouseWheel too.

To make MouseWheel start automatically at startup, add a shortcut to
mw.exe in your ...\Start Menu\Programs\Startup folder.

It would be much nicer if LW itself handled the wheel messages --
perhaps Xanalys could add that to the Wish List for the next release
or the one after?

&gt I have Win/2K running on a number of workstations running LWW 4.2

I think it depends on the (wheel) mouse driver. On my IBM Thinkpad
with Win2k LWW obeys the 'wheel' if I use the scroll feature of the
built-in trackpoint, but it doesn't if I use an external MS USB
wheelmouse (which works fine with other apps). I think the trackpoint
driver (and maybe other drivers, too) somehow actually emulates
scrolling on a lower level while the usual drivers interact more
'cleanly' with the Windows API. (Just my guess, I don't have much
experience with Windows.)
