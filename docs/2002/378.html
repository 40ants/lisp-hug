                <h1>Error during socket operation</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

With a HTTP server I've writting using LWW 4.2.6, I sometimes get an
error "Error during socket operation: code 10054".
This happens during a call to stream:stream-write-buffer, which is
called by stream:stream-flush-buffer, which is called by stream:force-output.

The error seems to occur only when two or more socket-streams are 
simultaneously open for output.

When I mask the error using ignore-errors, everything seems to work fine
(but maybe the socket stream isn't closed correctly).

Does anyone know what 'code 10054' means or, even better, how I can get
rid of the error?

Thanks a lot,

Arthur Lemmens

The error description is: 10054 An existing connection was forcibly closed
by the remote host. (WSAECONNRESET)

So it seems that the other end of the socket was closed.
