                <h1>Editing/compiling Unicode programs</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

I'm writing a Unicode program, i.e. a program whose source text
uses the UCS-2 character encoding.

I've managed to tell the editor that files with an extension of "ulisp"
use the UCS-2 character encoding and that it should use the Lisp major mode 
for such files.

Unfortunately, whenever I save such a file the editor automatically inserts
a Byte Order Mark (#xFEFF) in front of the file. That would not be a problem 
by itself, but when I try to compile &amp; load a file starting with the BOM, 
the compiler gives the following warning:
  ;;;*** Warning in (TOP-LEVEL-FORM 2): &lt;FEFF&gt assumed special
and then the loader tells me:
  The variable ? is unbound.
(I suppose that ? means the BOM here.)

When I remove the BOM from the file (with another editor), it compiles and 
loads normally.

So my question is:
  - Is there a way to tell the editor not to insert a BOM?
  - Or, even better, is there a way to tell the compiler that the BOM
    should be ignored (or treated as whitespace, or something like that)?
    I've tried setting SYSTEM:*EXTENDED-SPACES* to T, but that doesn't
    help.

Thanks in advance for any replies.

Arthur Lemmens
