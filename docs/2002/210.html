                <h1>structures and arrays : one conses the other doesn't</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

Sorry to trouble the list again, but I was wondering if there was any way to
stop the code in function 'testing' below from consing. Basically, I can see
(following on from advice given earlier) how I can avoid consing by 'wrapping'
my floating point ops as array -&gt array operations (thanks Tim). The code in
the function 'testing2' does this and does not cons. I guess what
I don't understand is why I cannot use structures (as in function 'testing')
to acheive the same effect.

It would basically be a lot 'nicer' to be able to use structures in this way
(for some of my code), rather than arrays.


(defstruct simple-struct
  (field-1 0.0D0 :type double-float))
(defparameter sa1 (make-array 1 :element-type 'double-float :initial-element 1.0D0))

(defparameter ss0 (make-simple-struct))

(defparameter sf1 1.0D0)
(defparameter sf2 2.0D0)

(defun testing2 (a b c)
  (declare (type double-float b c)
           (type (simple-array double-float (*)) a)
           (optimize (speed 3) (safety 0) #+LispWorks(float 0) (debug 0)))
    (setf (aref a 0) (+ b c))
  a)


(defun testing (a b c)
  (declare (type double-float b c d)
           (type simple-struct a)
           (optimize (speed 3) (safety 0) #+LispWorks(float 0) (debug 0)))
  (setf (simple-struct-field-1 a) (+ b c))
  a)

CL-USER 160 &gt (time (testing ss0 sf1 sf2))

user time    =      0.000
system time  =      0.000

Thanks again,

Barry.

(BTW : Thanks again to Dave for his performance hint (declaring the type of
the inner sum). But there was a minor bug in the code he posted :

(defun matrix-product (m1 m2 m3)
  (declare (type (simple-array single-float (* *)) m1 m2 m3))
  (declare (optimize (float 0) (safety 0)))
  (loop for i from 0 below (array-dimension m1 0)
      
        do
        (loop for j from 0 below (array-dimension m2 1)
              with sum of-type single-float = 0F0
              do
              (loop for alpha from 0 below (array-dimension m1 1)
                    do (incf sum (* (aref m1 i alpha) (aref m2 alpha j))))
              (setf (aref m3 i j) sum)))
  m3)

It should be :

(defun matrix-product (m1 m2 m3)
  (declare (type (simple-array single-float (* *)) m1 m2 m3)
           (optimize (speed 3) (safety 0) (float 0)))
  (loop for i fixnum from 0 below (array-dimension m1 0)
        do
        (loop for j fixnum from 0 below (array-dimension m2 1)
              do
              (loop for alpha fixnum from 0 below (array-dimension m1 1)
                    with sum of-type single-float = 0.0F0
                    do (incf sum (* (aref m1 i alpha) (aref m2 alpha j)))
                    finally (setf (aref m3 i j) sum))))
  m3)

where the inner sum is moved into the inner loop, and the array element set in a
finally clause. Otherwise, the sum is not zeroed until i is incremented.)

I think, as Nick says, the answer is that the special unboxed float
support is only implemented for arrays.

However it turns out that you can do this, which I think is not
completely portable, but seems to work on LWW:

(defstruct (foo (:type (vector single-float)))
  fish
  fob)

And then FOOs will actually be vectors of SINGLE-FLOATs.  I have not
tested this, but assuming structure accessors expand enough this
should mean that code involving FOOs will look very much like code
involving vectors.  You probably also need to define a type FOO which
translates as (VECTOR SINGLE-FLOAT 2) or something.

Thanks again Tim, this is exactly what I want. The following works perfectly :

(defstruct (foo (:type (vector single-float)))
  fish
  fob)

(deftype foo () `(simple-array single-float (2)))

(defun testing (a b c)
  (declare (type single-float b c d)
           (type foo a)
           (optimize (speed 3) (safety 0) #+LispWorks(float 0) (debug 0)))
  (setf (foo-fish a) (+ b c))
  a)

and yes, the above function does not cons. I will be using this quite a bit -
maybe not as nice as being able to specify different types at a slot level,
but very useful. I did not realise that one could specify the representation
to be used for a structure - this bit of the Hyperspec was new to me. 

To be honest, when I was (still am, of course) initially learning CL, I
concentrated on defclass rather than defstruct. This was probably a good thing
in general, but I now am aware that structures are very useful in their own
right, and in paticular where performance is critical.
