                <h1>raise-interface on Windows</h1>
                <pre>I have a "Bring all windows to front" command in my application which
uses capi:raise-interface on each window. This works fine in linux,
but under Windows, nothing happens.

Is it possible at all to raise windows under Windows?

I'm quite suprised that MS didn't include the "bring all windows to
front" feature per default, i.e.as a right-click command on the task
bar in Win XP, which _does_ include other commands (tiling) which
raise all windows.

(I have very little Windows programming experience - I develop with LW
 for linux and port to Windows. Thanks to Xanalys for making their
 tool so remarkably cross-platform capable!)
