                <h1>Tuning GC</h1>
                <pre>I'm going to tune GC and because this is my first time tuning GC, I
don't know what I should do exactly.

At least, I'd like to do following operations:

* Examine each generation and static segment space to find what objects
are there. So, I need some mapping functions (In LW manual there is only
one mapping function which is for all objects of all generations -
sweep-all-object). I found (maybe) some mapping functions with 'apropos'
but don't know how to use them (e.g. raw::sweep-generation-objects, but
seg violation occurs when I tried).

* Prevent promotion of certain objects - e.g. leave some objects forever
in generation 0. I have some (at the moment, one or two) objects  which
lives for a while then can be GCed. (e.g. after a long time cunsuming
thread finished, those objects are GCable).

Also, I'd like to hear GC tuning experience of other LW Lispers.

Cheers,

- Jong-won

I don't think that makes sense.  Even if it's possible (I suspect it
isn't), if you force objects to sit in the zeroth generation for ever
then the GC has to look at them every time it runs.  Since the first
generation is GCd frequently this will slow down GC for ever.  Better
to let them migrate in the normal way to a higher generation and then
the GC will pick them up in due course.  If you want to be sure that
they are GCd when whatever long-lived process that has been hanging
onto them lets them go then the answer I think is to trigger a GC of
the higher generation at that point.

I think the classic problem here is that the objects live long enough
that they make it into a generation which is really big and probably
is never normally GCd.  Manually triggering a GC of this space then
causes really long pauses (seconds).

I'm not really familiar with the LW GC, but I suspect it is possible
to have a `really never looked at' generation which is genuinely never
GCd (I think this is generation 3 in LW) and some `normally never
looked at' generation just below it (I think this is generation 2 in
LW) from which objects are not promoted except on special request.
What should then happen is that stuff ends up in this generation,
which you need to manually scavenge every once in a while.  The
problem then becomes if this generation gets too big so that scavenge
takes a long time.  I think the fix for that is either to give up, or
to tweak how often the GC of generations below that one run to avoid
too much promotion into it.

At a meta-level, as far as I can see there are really two issues which
typically matter with GC: one is how much the amortised cost of it is
over the life of the program, and the other is how long you might have
to pause.  A third possible issue is how much more memory you end up
using because of it (and this can sometimes be traded against the
other two).  The third issue is often not a problem nowadays except
for *very* large applications or very space-constrained systems such
as embedded ones.  In any case the first thing to do is to actually
measure things to see how bad the problem is.  Every time I do this, I
find that the amortised cost is under 10% which is low enough that I
don't generally worry, since the biggest win I might get is probably
only 5% of execution time.  Long GC pauses at bad times can still be a
problem I think and, short of a concurrent GC, I think the only
approach which works here is to look carefully at what is being
promoted and try and be sure that the largest-GCd-generation never
gets too large.  One approach to that is to cause it to be GCd *more
often* which will probably cause amortised GC cost to be higher but
reduce the worst-case pause.

All this is just my experience of course.  I'd really like to hear
from other people who have done tuning of the LW GC (or other GCs).
