                <h1>preventing Xanalys screen</h1>
                <pre>When I run LispWorks, I get the Xanalys LispWorks box which appears in the
middle of the screen and covers everything else for a few seconds. How can I
prevent it from appearing at all? (This is annoying when running a batch
file to deliver an exe or dll).

Thanks,
Iddo

If you run  what I think is a `console' image then you don't get
this.  I save a 4.2.x console image on Windows with a script like
this:

    ;;;; Save a patched image
    ;;;

    #+lispworks4.1
    (load "load-patches")
    #+lispworks4.2
    (load-all-patches)

    ;; Don't load anything here as this image is used to ship code
    ;(load "lw-commands")

    (save-image 
     #+lispworks4.1
     "lispworks-4120-console"
     #+lispworks4.2
     "lispworks-42-current-console"
     :clean-down t
     :console t)

    (quit)

And I then use this from things like Makefiles to compile &amp; deliver
code:

    lw -init deliver-ngdm.lisp

say.  It doesn't produce a splash screen.

I haven't tried (and I don't think it's really fair to try) to disable
the splash screen for a development image.

Incidentally can anyone else confirm that there's an entertaining
easter egg in the splash screen? (on Linux at least, I've never seen
it on Windows).
