Hi,

Does anyone know how to build a "tree-view" ? (somethig similar to the
left part of the "explorer" of windows)
or does anyone know where to find documentation about it?

thanks,
regards,
Miro Casanova

Only in 4.2 I'm afraid.

Here is a horrible little thing I wrote which may give some idea.
Sorry for the .tar.gz file, it has .bmp images in it.  I have no idea
if this is anything like the right way to do this, I just wrote it as
a hack.  I've only tested it on Windows but it kind of should work on
Linux/Unix I think (my Linux box is turned off at the moment and we
don't have a Solaris license...).

There's no sysdcl, it should be enough to compile &amp; load
directory-browser.lisp.  I think this only works in 4.2, but I seem to
remember using it in 4.1.20, so maybe?

                 <pre>It is documented in the CAPI Reference Manual (and does work under 4.1)

In the simplest case it works just like below.  You can also attach the
selection-callback, etc to provide functionality.

CL-USER 11 &gt (setf *roots* '((1 (2) (3) (4)) (5 (6) (7) (8))))
((1 (2) (3) (4)) (5 (6) (7) (8)))

CL-USER 12 &gt (capi:contain
             (make-instance 'capi:tree-view
                            :roots *roots*
                            :print-function
                            (lambda (node)
                              (princ-to-string (first node)))
                            :children-function 'rest))
#&lt;CAPI:TREE-VIEW [2 items] 212AFF9C&gt

CL-USER 13 &gt

Is there something more specific you are asking?  Are you concerned on how to build the
data structures that represent the tree?
