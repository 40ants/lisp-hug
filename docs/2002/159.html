1.3.2 is probably the dll version.  Unfortunately things probably
depend on all three of what bash does, what the dll does with what
bash does, and what lispworks does.  

My suspicion is that the place to start would be to understand how
things like *terminal-io* get set up in terms of the underlying win32
stuff, because one could perhaps then understand what it is cygwin is
doing that makes all this break, and then somehow either robustify it
against all the things cygwin could do, or at least know what the
issues are.

My intuitions kind of break down on windows because I'm such a Unix
person, but if lispworks starts from some kind of `standard C'
environment, I wonder what the values of file descriptors 0, 1 and 2
refer to on cygwin and `native' windows.  In general in windows it
really is not clear to me what they do refer to since there isn't
generally some sensible default place for output to go.  Maybe win32
documents what this is, and somehow that doesn't quite agree with what
it is under cygwin?

However redirection stdout is a good workaround for me!

&gt Anyway, Nick's suggestion to get a working version of cygwin sounds
&gt better to me.

Unfortunately a working version isn't easily available as far as I can
see - like you I just upgraded to the most recent one (from one dated
Feb sometime which I had before) and it still doesn't work.

However I hadn't realised (being a fool) that if I save a :console t
image I get something which, from the point of view of cygwin looks
just like a normal shell-callable program.  This is now even better!
