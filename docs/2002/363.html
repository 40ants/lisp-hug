                <h1>Telling the editor that something else is a paren?</h1>
                <pre>Does anyone know how you can tell the editor that something other than
"(" is a paren?  I would like something like character syntax in
Emacs, but perhaps slightly more general, because my delimiter is more
than one character.

To be really specific, I have things like

   #["format-control" arg ...]

which expand at read time to docstrings (and do various other things),
and I'd like it to know that #[ is an open paren (or maybe just [ is
an open paren) &amp; ] is a closed one)

Thanks

&gt Hi

&gt does anybody know how to implement a "wait for input" function on an
&gt interactive pane?

&gt I.e. something like

&gt     (defun repl (interface interactive-pane i/o-stream)
&gt         (loop (wait-until-something-on i/o-stream)
&gt               (read i/o-stream)))

&gt Of course the rest of the application should not hang.

Can you not just start a thread to do this?  If you need to
synchronize with someone else you can then use the normal thread
synchronization stuff (mailboxes?).

Here's the reply I was composing before I noticed notice-fd :-).&nbsp; If
the above isn't what you want, read on...<br><br>
You might need to describe the problem in more detail.<br><br>
As far as I can tell, Nick suggested something like:<br><br>
<font face="Courier New, Courier">&lt;stream 1&gt; --- &lt;process
1&gt;----&gt;&gt; function1<br><br>
&lt;stream 2&gt; --- &lt;process 2&gt;----&gt;&gt; function2<br>
....<br><br>
</font>The only difference between this and my decades-old recollection
of what Unix select does is that Unix select waits for an input event
from one-of-many-possible sources, and, that at most one of these sources
is processed at a time (i.e. the process containing the select is a
&quot;server&quot;).&nbsp; The suggestion above allows more than one
stream to be processed &quot;at the same time&quot;, each thread is a
separate server.<br><br>
In general, to convert a bunch of parallel events into a time-ordered
sequence, you need one &quot;server&quot; and a queue, something
like:<br><br>
<font face="Courier New, Courier">&lt;stream 1&gt; --- &lt;process 1&gt;
-&gt;&gt; function 1 ----+<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
|<br>
&lt;stream 2&gt; --- &lt;process 2&gt; -&gt;&gt; function 2 ----+---&gt;
queue, &lt;process 0&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
|<br>
....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
----+<br><br>
</font>I haven't tried this in Xanalys Lisp, but a quick look at the MP
reference section suggests that the queue should be a mailbox, process 0
(the &quot;serializing&quot; server) should be a mailbox-reader and that
functions 1-N simply drop the corresponding stream objects into the queue
(mailbox) and go back to waiting for new activity on the 
stream.<br><br>
So, process 0, the server, is a loop that waits for a stream to appear in
the mailbox, then runs the appropriate application code with that
stream.&nbsp; If any of the other streams fire while the first stream is
being processed, their stream-objects will be dropped into the mailbox
queue.&nbsp; When process 0 finishes working on the 1st stream, it comes
around and reads the mailbox&nbsp; - if some stream object is queued up,
it gets processed immediately, if the queue is empty, the server waits
until something arrives (implicit in the fact that mailbox-read is a
blocking read).<br><br>

&gt Nope.  I need something working on a STREAM.  Not a file descriptor.
&gt Unless you can get to the file descriptor from the listener pane.

Maybe not what you want, but this little hack was quite useful for me
once (on Solaris LW 4.1):

(defmethod get-unix-fd-from-stream ((x stream))
  (slot-value x 'stream::file-handle))

(defmethod get-unix-fd-from-stream ((x comm:socket-stream))
  (slot-value x 'comm::socket))
