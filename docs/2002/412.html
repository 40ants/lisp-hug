                <h1>using VC++ debugger for fli</h1>
                <pre>Thought I'd check before concluding that this is a stupid idea...

Under Windows 2000, I've got a "master" lisp program which does fli calls 
to C routines sitting in a dll file.

It would be very convenient if I could debug the C dll using DevStudio 
while it is running as a subordinate of the lisp program.  Can this be done 
in some way?

[At present, I debug the C dll separately under DevStudio, then bolt it 
into my lisp program.  When the C dll crashes under lisp, I have to go back 
to the stand-alone devstudio version and try to suss out why it crashed.]

thanx

You just have to put the Lispworks executable in
Project Settings/Debug/executable for debug session

Start up Visual Studio. Instead of openning a project, open the LispWorks
exe.
It'll complain there isn't any debug info, but run it in the debugger.
You'll have to
inform VS of the DLL you want to debug first (use project options). Set
break
points in the DLL as usual and you're there.
