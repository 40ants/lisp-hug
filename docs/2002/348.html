                <h1>A hack for LW: CLC, the Common/CORBA Lisp Client</h1>
                <pre>This is a little program which uses CORBA to allow you to call into a
Lisp server program from the Unix (or Windows) command line.  It's
very naive in several ways - I wrote it mostly to learn some CORBA.  A
sane version would have the server sitting on a socket, but why do
that when you can do something really complicated?  The server is
particularly naive - I think it wants to do even more complicated
things to allow it to be properly multithreaded, but I don't
understand that stuff yet.

The client could be in any language which does CORBA, but the current
one is a delivered LispWorks application.  It's about 3Mb (with
delivery level 5), but is plenty fast (something about 0.1s round trip
for a null call).  I have a scheme to make it a dll or something so it
looks small the way C systems do...

Anyway, the sources are at http://www.tfeb.org/programs/clc.tar.gz.
There is a README but that's it for documentation.  You need LW +
CORBA to build, I have tested on Windows &amp; Linux only at this point.
If anyone uses it please let me know.

Thanks,
