                <pre>
Hi,

I have a little question. I've got an interface object defined by the
following class:

(capi:define-interface main-interface ()
  ((browser :accessor browser :initarg :browser)
   (library-structure :accessor library-structure :initarg
:library-structure))
  (:panes   ...blablabla....)
  (:layouts
    (main-tab-layout
    capi:tab-layout
    '(tree-pane-1)
    :items (list (list "Browser" browser) (list "Library's Structure"
library-structure))
    :visible-child-function 'second
    :print-function 'car
    :selection 0))
   (etc etc etc...))   ---&gt end of interface

I create a new interface by assigning 2 objects to the browser and
library-structure slots...like this:

(setf aa (make-instance
                    'capi:output-pane
                    :background :red))

(setf bb (make-instance
                    'capi:output-pane
                    :background :blue))

(setf it (make-instance 'main-interface
                    :browser aa
                    :library-structure bb))

(capi:contain it)

Now, the problem I've got is that I do the following somewhere else in
the application:

(defun import-callback (data interface)
  (let ((path-name
         (capi:prompt-for-file "Choose a structure file:"
                               :filter "*.st"
                               :filters '("All Files" "*.*")))
        (test-instance (make-tester)))
    (if (not (null path-name))
        (let ((sr (test-1 test-instance (namestring path-name))))
          (setf (library-structure interface) (tree-generator
(dimensions sr)))     ********** HERE
          (capi:redisplay-interface
interface))                                                 **********
HERE
        nil)))

this import-callback function is invoked by selecting "import" in the
menu of the interface defined above (it doesn't appear in this mail
because it's too long). The problem is that I try to assign to the slot
library-structure of the interface a new value (I can do it), but the
problem is that it doesn't update the interface. The function
"tree-generator generates a tree-view with the results.
I know that the function and the results work, because if I add a
capi:contain in the same tree-generator function I get a new window with
the tree I calculated.
Does anyone know how to update the interface with the new value of the
library-structure slot of the interface?

thanks in advance for your time,
regards,
Miro Casanova

You have to do something like, to set the items in tab-layout to a new tree.

(setf (capi:layout-description (slot-value interface 'main-tab-layout))
    (list (list "Browser" (slot-value interface 'browser))
          (list "Library's Structure"
              (setf (library-structure interface)
                     (tree-generator dimensions sr)))))

There are probably better ways to get a better interface, such as changing the roots of
the current tree view in the interface.  Then tree-generator can return the roots (instead
of a new tree-view) and you update the interface with,

(setf (capi:tree-view-roots (slot-value interface 'tree-view-pane))
    (tree-generator dimensions sr))

where tree-view-pane is a pane slot in your interface and is an item in tab-layout.
