                <h1>RE: Just gotta know - does anyone use CLIM ... ???</h1>
                <pre>I've been using CLIM since 1989. Although maybe in 1989 it was the CLIM
predecessor, TV, on Symbolics. At Alcoa we have two large applications that
use the Franz Allegro version of CLIM. I do believe that CLIM's user base is
very small at this point, although it has allowed us to port our application
from Unix to Windows without a lot of grief. And from Lucid to Allegro
without much grief when Lucid bellied up. I am sure it has been at least a
decade since the remaining CLIM vendors spoke to one another (on the topic
of CLIM) and the Allegro and Xanalys CLIM implementations have diverged. The
truth is the Lisp vendors want to lock you into their proprietary interface
scheme and even then the interest in having interface code portable between
platforms within a vendor is not of much interest to them. As for your
specific question I do not understand it enough to make a guess. I ask many
CLIM questions of my vendor Franz. I do get replies have you asked Xanalys
your question? Also you need to provide example code. Not a snippet but a
stripped down fully working or nonworking example with instructions on how
to reproduce the behavior in question.

&gt 
&gt 
&gt 
&gt I'm sorry, but this is a rant, of sorts...
&gt 
&gt I've posted question regarding CLIM in the past, including today.
&gt They've always gone without reply, leading me to draw the 
&gt following conclusions:
&gt 
&gt (1) They are incredibly stupid questions thus not deserving 
&gt of a response. 
&gt 
&gt (2) No one has anything useful to say. This I doubt - the 
&gt Lisp programmers I've 
&gt know over the last 15 years are a bright lot.
&gt 
&gt (3) No one uses CLIM! I do. I'm living in the past???
&gt 
&gt Thanks,
&gt Greg
