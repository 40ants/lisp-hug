&gt We have had several requests for LispWorks source code, for various
&gt modules, over the years. Would people want the sources for:
&gt 
&gt - The core LispWorks engine?
&gt - CAPI and the IDE?
&gt - The Editor?
&gt - Enterprise modules?
&gt 
&gt Would they expect to pay for the inclusion of source code?
&gt 
I realise that this is a bit late in this discussion - but one piece of code I
would really like to see is the CLIM-based development environment called
'Bagel' mentioned by Kent Pitman in this article on c.l.l :

http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=sfwd7xood41.fsf%40world.std.com

I appreciate that any level of support is out of the question - but if it has
been abandoned by the company, I would dearly love to see it.

Regards,

Barry Wilkes.
