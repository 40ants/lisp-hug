                <h1>`commands' in LW</h1>
                <pre>Does anyone know how things like the `colon commands' that LW defines
in various contexts are defined, and whether they can be defined in a
general listener?  ACL gives you a way of doing this, I think, and it
would be cool if it existed for LW, as they're quite useful.

(I specifically find that I want to have hacky (push-package xxx) and
(pop-package) utilities, but these are quite painful to define as
functions because the package keeps changing so you have to type
package prefixes all the time, being able to say `:push-package "FOO"'
&amp;c would be nice).

Thanks

Yes, thanks!  I'd even found system::*user-commands* but for some
reason had not worked out what it did, maybe because I didn't think to
look at it when in the debugger to see what it had been bound to.

Thanks.

Except it doesn't work, sigh.  Something (system::%top-level perhaps)
unilaterally rebinds this, so if you assign to it then it only works
for the listener you are in, and you don't seem to be able to assign
to it in an init file.  Dang.  At least I know where to look now.

Dang, I should have traced this like you said.  Advising it works.  I
think it would be cool if the real function could be changed to do
essentially what this advice does, for some documented variable.

Anyway, the attached seems to work.

                 <pre>For what it's worth, I put up a slightly souped-up version of the
`define-a-colon-command' hack at
http://www.tfeb.org/lisp/implementation-hax.html#LW-COLON-COMMANDS

This at least works well enough for me.

Does anyone know how to bind such commands to keyboard keys without
necessity to press the Enter key explicitly after the command name? For
example, I'd like the assignments:

    :s (Step)     F8
    :su (Step out)    F10

But the following call

    (bind-string-to-key (string-append  #\: #\s #\Linefeed) #\F8)

only splits a listener line but doesn't emulate pressing Enter
afterwards. Any takers?

| Try this, which calls the command function of that command.
|
| (editor:defcommand "Step" (p)
|    "Step. Really ought to check that it's at the prompt."
|    "Step"
|    (declare (ignore p))

(editor:execute-or-insert-newline-or-yank-from-previous-prompt-command
nil))
|
| (editor:bind-key "Step" "F8" :mode "Execute")

Thanks, Dave!

FWIW my final version is as follows:

(defcommand "StepInto" (p)
    "Step. Really ought to check that it's at the prompt."
    "Step"
  (insert-string (editor:current-point) (format nil ":s ~@[~A~]" p))
  (execute-or-insert-newline-or-yank-from-previous-prompt-command nil))
