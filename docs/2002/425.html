                <h1>CLOS obscurity in delivery</h1>
                <pre>I have an application which I am delivering at delivery level 0.  I
want to split it into chunks, so there will be a bunch of fasls which
it loads (or doesn't) at boot time.  This is mostly so we can provide
new bits of functionality or fixes without having to ship a whole new
image (and in turn, this is mostly political &amp; convenience, I'm not
stressing about size).

What I do is: compile it all.  Concatenate various systems into big
fasls, and load the core systems, then dump an image.  At boot time
the system then loads some of these other systems.

One class that is dumped in the image has an initialize-instance
method that does something like:

 (with-slots (lock) ob
   (setf lock ...))

This class is subclassed in one of the systems loaded at boot time.
When an instance of this subclass is created, it gets an error saying
that the slot is missing in the object.  It seems to have the slot
name correct (including package).

It looks like something is optimizing too much information away about
the slot, or ?  Nothing I tried (keep-clos, various other of the
clos-related options to deliver) seems to help.  Dumping the system
with the image does help.

Is there anything I can do to avoid this?  It's really a pain if you
can never subclass classes that are defined in a delivered image in
loaded code.

I understand this better now.  If a class is defined in the delivered
image, and a subclass defined in a loaded FASL file, then the
effective slots of the subclass to not include the effective slots of
the superclass, so you lose horribly.

I've tried the various keep-effective-slots thingies, and keep-clos to
no avail, anyone know anything else I can do?  Is this meant to work?

I had to add this when I wanted to load some patch files at run-time for my
app (coz the patch files were redefining some classes for instance...)

That works, brilliant! Thank you, I owe you drinks of your choice,
you've saved me from embarrassment and late nights.

Dave (or anyone else who really knows!): is this enough to be sure
that class definitions in loaded fasl files will definitely work?  I'm
delivering with level 0 and :keep-clos :no-empty (and a couple of
other things like :multiprocessing t, but that should not matter I
think).

It used to work for me(*), but I forgot that this keyword pair was the magic
words, so I had just sent a question to Xanalys support as I saw Sebastiens 
answer and remembered that that did the trick. I guess I owe Sebastien 
a drink as well ;-)

(*) My previous employer has a system that does lots of fancy dynamic stuff
    (class definitions are constructed from database tables) and as far as
    I remember we didn't use any other strange keywords. But then, my
    memory has just proven to be inadequate, so...

&gt Thanks, I changed all the fonts in this file to one that works (courier 12)

If you don't want changes to be global, it's maybe better to
copy this to your .Xdefaults-&lt;insert your hostname here&gt file.

(and remember that you also can modify X resources with -xrm parameters
 on startup)
