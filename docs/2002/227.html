                <h1>getting UncommonSQL working in LispWorks on windows</h1>
                <pre>Sorry if this appears to be a repeat message, I've been having some 
problems getting this posted to this particular mailing list.

We're evaluating the LispWorks environment on Windows2000 and WindowsXP 
and we wanted to try UncommonSQL to connect to the postgresql server 
from RedHat cygwin.  Although it didn't all work "out-of-the-box", we 
did eventually get it working.  For those that wish to follow in our 
footsteps, we've put together a webpage describing what is needed. Soon 
the UncommonSQL sources should get patched to make this even simpler to 
get working.

The web page is

        http://homepage.mac.com/rkris/lispworks-usql.html

So far, we are quite happy with how well the combination seems to be 
working.

                 <pre>Excuse my asking this on lisp-hug, but I figured maybe others might
not know the answer. Just what is the correct pronunciation of
Xanalys? Is the "X" pronounced seperately as in "X - analys" or
is the "X" pronounced as a "Z" as in "Zanalys", or is it something
different altogether.
