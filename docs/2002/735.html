                <h1>Disabiling the splash screen when a dll is loaded</h1>
                <pre>I am looking into using lispworks to write a dll (actually, an xll) as
part of a project I am working on.  The example given in the
delivery manual under the entry for :dll-exports works fine.  However,
I cannot work out how to prevent the LispWorks splash screen from
being displayed when the dll is loaded.  Can anyone tell me how to do
this?

Thanks,

Barry.

                 <pre>Deliver the applicaction. Use severity level 0. You'll encounter a few
gotchas, for example: you must cl:require all your modules before you
deliver the app (take espeical care if you're using editor-panes, as
some key bindings autoload modules); the LW-TOOLS package is removed
upon delivery; and so on.
