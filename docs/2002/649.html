                <h1>"Eliminating a test of a variable with a declared type"</h1>
                <pre>Hi!

I have some code that compiles and works fine with CMUCL and ACL. With
Lispworks it also does what it's supposed to do but I get a lot of
"Eliminating a test of a variable with a declared type" warnings when
compiling. I have no idea what this means and don't know where to look
at in the docs to find more information about this message.

Could somebody shed a light on this?

Thanks in advance,
Edi.

&gt Code like this:
&gt 
&gt (DEFMETHOD OBJECT-LENGTH ((X STRING)) (WHEN X (LENGTH X)))
&gt 
&gt generates such a warning when compiled. The type of x is known to the
&gt compiler, because the specialization effectively declares the type. It
&gt means there is an unnecessary IF/WHEN/UNLESS test such as
&gt  
&gt  (WHEN X ...)
&gt 
&gt above and the compiler is removing the test. There are other ways in
&gt which the type can be inferred and this optimization is performed.

Thanks for the quick reply. This was exactly what I was looking for
and it helped me to find a couple of places in my code where indeed
unnecessary tests where happening (remnants from earlier version of
the program).

&gt The warning is rather mysterious in LispWorks 4.2.0 when the
&gt declaration is not explicit because it doesn't say which variable and
&gt type. You are not the first to be confused by it. In LW4.2.6 we added
&gt the variable to the warning and in LW4.2.7 we added the type as
&gt well. So now the warning is better:
&gt 
&gt ;;;*** Warning in (METHOD OBJECT-LENGTH (STRING)): Eliminating a test of a variable with a declared type : X [type STRING]
&gt 
&gt which should help you to locate the unnecessary tests.

Er, yes, I _am_ using LW pro 4.2.7, so I got the more verbose
messages. I still was to0 confused to get it myself. (Or let's say I
didn't expect the compiler to be that smart - shame on me.)

Thanks again,
Edi.
