                <h1>X resources</h1>
                <pre>Does anyone have any sample X resource files for LW on Linux (or Unix
I suppose)?  I've changed mine to make the colours &amp; fonts more to my
taste, but I still have some problems with fonts - really I want to
make any fixed-width font be a lucida typewriter, but I couldn't make
this work for some reason, and being lazy I thought I'd see if anyone
else had resources which looked OK to me...

Thanks

I have changed my ressources and use a special version of the OpenMotif
Library that looks more similar to SGIs Irix.

I have attached my .Xdefaults file which contains modifications of
general Motif look and special modifications to LW CLIMs look.

I don't know how this looks with plain OpenMotif or Lesstif.
If someone is interested in the Irix lookalike Motif they can mail me
privately.

ciao,
Jochen
