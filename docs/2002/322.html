                <h1>[Q] mp:schedule-timer-relative in LWW4.2</h1>
                <pre>Hello,

Is the MP:SCHEDULE-TIMER-RELATIVE function disabled in the personal
edition of LWW4.2?

I tried the following and did not see anything in the Output buffer:

(defvar *timer* (mp:make-timer #'princ "ding!"))
(mp:schedule-timer-relative *timer* 60 60)

I see the entry for the PRINC callback in MP::*TIME-EVENTS-LIST*, but
as far as I can tell, it's not being called.

Then I started to wonder if it's deliberately disabled to prevent
people from trying to deal with the time limit of the Personal
edition.

Regards,

-ram

                  <pre>Thanks Dave (and Nick).  Specifying the output stream was what I was
missing.

The thing that threw me off was that I first tried scheduling the
timer with MP:SCHEDULE-TIMER and it executed the PRINC right away and
sent that output, correctly, to the Output buffer; but knowing what I
know now, that was probably because the absolute time I had,
incorrectly, passed it was already well behind the current run-time,
and the timer probably never got spawned in a new thread, with the
standard output redirected.

Anyway, thanks again.

&gt No, like most of the base lisp functionality it's the same as in the
&gt Professional/Enterprise Editions.
&gt
&gt    I tried the following and did not see anything in the Output buffer:
&gt
&gt    (defvar *timer* (mp:make-timer #'princ "ding!"))
&gt    (mp:schedule-timer-relative *timer* 60 60)
&gt

&gt    as far as I can tell, it's not being called.
&gt
&gt I think it is called but the output goes to *terminal-io*. Try this:
&gt
&gt CL-USER 3 &gt (setf ss *standard-output*)
&gt #&lt;EDITOR::RUBBER-STREAM #&lt;EDITOR:BUFFER CAPI interactive-pane 2&gt&gt
&gt
&gt CL-USER 4 &gt (mp:make-timer 'print 10 ss)
&gt #&lt;Time Event : PRINT&gt
&gt
&gt CL-USER 5 &gt (mp:schedule-timer-relative (setf *timer* *) 1)
&gt #&lt;Time Event : PRINT&gt
&gt
&gt 10 
&gt CL-USER 6 &gt
