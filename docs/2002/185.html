                <h1>OpenGL on LispWorks 4.2 on Linux</h1>
                <pre>Is it possible that the OpenGL example
has again stopped to work in the actual release of LispWorks 4.2?

I know that there was a patch that fixed the LW4.2 beta 
(visual-info-for-color.ufsl) - (I by myself sent in a bugreport about
this)

But as it seems this function is again undefined in the actual release
:-(

Have I done something wrong?
Has anybody got it running?

ciao,
Jochen

I'd like to know that, too.  I tried on LispWorks 4.2 for Linux and
the nvidia drivers, but only got a crash or something (don't
remember).  I didn't investigate much and didn't file a bug report,
yet.
