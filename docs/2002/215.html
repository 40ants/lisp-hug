                <h1>archive of this mailing list?</h1>
                <pre>Hi all,

	I'm new to this mailing-list and wonder whether
there is an archive where I can download the last 1,2,3 years
of messages?

Maybe s.b. could simply let me download his .tar.gz folder
of that mailing list. Thanks a lot in advance.

Just in case you wonder why I'm interested in that?
From experience I've learnt that one can learn an incredible
lot by skimming through old mailings - and certainly save
the group from too many questions you already discussed before.

Thanks,
Armin.

                 <pre>Armin,

A few weeks back I asked the same question on the list, and I figured
I'd pass on what Julian Lomberg sent me (see below). I did verify the
instructions, and as Julian suggested use the @xanalys.com domain
instead of the @harlequin.co.uk.

Perhaps if we all ask very nicely, the list administrator might
consider a web-page that hosts these instructions instead of having
these instructions take more and more space in the archives, every
time this question is asked and answered.

Regards,

-ram

&gt Subject: List archive?
&gt
&gt
&gt&gt Sorry if this is an oft asked question, but is this mailing list archived 
&gt
&gt Don't worry, it is not an oft asked question.
&gt
&gt Below are the instructions emailed to me when I signed up. They include
&gt commands to get the archive. I emailed these to someone else about a month
&gt ago who wanted the archive and he confirmed to me that it still works. I
&gt have no idea if all the other functionality described below still works however.
&gt The email below was from the time before the transition of Harlequin to
&gt Xanalys was complete so be careful to substitute xanalys.com  instead of
&gt harlequin.com as the domain names for all email adresses below.
&gt
&gt Hope that helps,

&gt
&gt&gt This help message is being sent to you from the Majordomo mailing list
&gt&gt management system at Majordomo@harlequin.com.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt This is version 1.94.3 of Majordomo.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt If you're familiar with mail servers, an advanced user's summary of
&gt&gt Majordomo's commands appears at the end of this message.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt Majordomo is an automated system which allows users to subscribe
&gt&gt and unsubscribe to mailing lists, and to retrieve files from list
&gt&gt archives.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt You can interact with the Majordomo software by sending it commands
&gt&gt in the body of mail messages addressed to "Majordomo@harlequin.com".
&gt&gt Please do not put your commands on the subject line; Majordomo does
&gt&gt not process commands in the subject line.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt You may put multiple Majordomo commands in the same mail message.
&gt&gt Put each command on a line by itself.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt If you use a "signature block" at the end of your mail, Majordomo may
&gt&gt mistakenly believe each line of your message is a command; you will
&gt&gt then receive spurious error messages.  To keep this from happening,
&gt&gt either put a line starting with a hyphen ("-") before your signature,
&gt&gt or put a line with just the word
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt end
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt on it in the same place.  This will stop the Majordomo software from
&gt&gt processing your signature as bad commands.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt Here are some of the things you can do using Majordomo:
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt I. FINDING OUT WHICH LISTS ARE ON THIS SYSTEM
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt To get a list of publicly-available mailing lists on this system, put the
&gt&gt following line in the body of your mail message to Majordomo@harlequin.com:
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt lists
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt Each line will contain the name of a mailing list and a brief description
&gt&gt of the list.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt To get more information about a particular list, use the "info" command,
&gt&gt supplying the name of the list.  For example, if the name of the list 
&gt&gt about which you wish information is "demo-list", you would put the line
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt info demo-list
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt in the body of the mail message.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt II. SUBSCRIBING TO A LIST
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt Once you've determined that you wish to subscribe to one or more lists on
&gt&gt this system, you can send commands to Majordomo to have it add you to the
&gt&gt list, so you can begin receiving mailings.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt To receive list mail at the address from which you're sending your mail,
&gt&gt simply say "subscribe" followed by the list's name:
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt subscribe demo-list
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt If for some reason you wish to have the mailings go to a different address
&gt&gt (a friend's address, a specific other system on which you have an account,
&gt&gt or an address which is more correct than the one that automatically appears 
&gt&gt in the "From:" header on the mail you send), you would add that address to
&gt&gt the command.  For instance, if you're sending a request from your work
&gt&gt account, but wish to receive "demo-list" mail at your personal account
&gt&gt (for which we will use "jqpublic@my-isp.com" as an example), you'd put
&gt&gt the line
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt subscribe demo-list jqpublic@my-isp.com
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt in the mail message body.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt Based on configuration decisions made by the list owners, you may be added 
&gt&gt to the mailing list automatically.  You may also receive notification
&gt&gt that an authorization key is required for subscription.  Another message
&gt&gt will be sent to the address to be subscribed (which may or may not be the
&gt&gt same as yours) containing the key, and directing the user to send a
&gt&gt command found in that message back to Majordomo@harlequin.com.  (This can be
&gt&gt a bit of extra hassle, but it helps keep you from being swamped in extra
&gt&gt email by someone who forged requests from your address.)  You may also
&gt&gt get a message that your subscription is being forwarded to the list owner
&gt&gt for approval; some lists have waiting lists, or policies about who may
&gt&gt subscribe.  If your request is forwarded for approval, the list owner
&gt&gt should contact you soon after your request.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt Upon subscribing, you should receive an introductory message, containing
&gt&gt list policies and features.  Save this message for future reference; it
&gt&gt will also contain exact directions for unsubscribing.  If you lose the
&gt&gt intro mail and would like another copy of the policies, send this message
&gt&gt to Majordomo@harlequin.com:
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt intro demo-list
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt (substituting, of course, the real name of your list for "demo-list").
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt III. UNSUBSCRIBING FROM MAILING LISTS
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt Your original intro message contains the exact command which should be
&gt&gt used to remove your address from the list.  However, in most cases, you
&gt&gt may simply send the command "unsubscribe" followed by the list name:
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt unsubscribe demo-list
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt (This command may fail if your provider has changed the way your
&gt&gt address is shown in your mail.)
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt To remove an address other than the one from which you're sending
&gt&gt the request, give that address in the command:
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt unsubscribe demo-list jqpublic@my-isp.com
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt In either of these cases, you can tell Majordomo@harlequin.com to remove
&gt&gt the address in question from all lists on this server by using "*"
&gt&gt in place of the list name:
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt unsubscribe *
&gt&gt unsubscribe * jqpublic@my-isp.com
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt IV. FINDING THE LISTS TO WHICH AN ADDRESS IS SUBSCRIBED
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt To find the lists to which your address is subscribed, send this command
&gt&gt in the body of a mail message to Majordomo@harlequin.com:
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt which
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt You can look for other addresses, or parts of an address, by specifying
&gt&gt the text for which Majordomo should search.  For instance, to find which
&gt&gt users at my-isp.com are subscribed to which lists, you might send the
&gt&gt command
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt which my-isp.com
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt Note that many list owners completely or fully disable the "which"
&gt&gt command, considering it a privacy violation.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt V. FINDING OUT WHO'S SUBSCRIBED TO A LIST
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt To get a list of the addresses on a particular list, you may use the
&gt&gt "who" command, followed by the name of the list:
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt who demo-list
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt Note that many list owners allow only a list's subscribers to use the
&gt&gt "who" command, or disable it completely, believing it to be a privacy
&gt&gt violation.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt VI. RETRIEVING FILES FROM A LIST'S ARCHIVES
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt Many list owners keep archives of files associated with a list.  These
&gt&gt may include:
&gt&gt - back issues of the list
&gt&gt - help files, user profiles, and other documents associated with the list
&gt&gt - daily, monthly, or yearly archives for the list
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt To find out if a list has any files associated with it, use the "index"
&gt&gt command:
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt index demo-list
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt If you see files in which you're interested, you may retrieve them by
&gt&gt using the "get" command and specifying the list name and archive filename.
&gt&gt For instance, to retrieve the files called "profile.form" (presumably a
&gt&gt form to fill out with your profile) and "demo-list.9611" (presumably the
&gt&gt messages posted to the list in November 1996), you would put the lines
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt get demo-list profile.form
&gt&gt get demo-list demo-list.9611
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt in your mail to Majordomo@harlequin.com.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt VII. GETTING MORE HELP
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt To contact a human site manager, send mail to Majordomo-Owner@harlequin.com.
&gt&gt To contact the owner of a specific list, send mail to that list's
&gt&gt approval address, which is formed by adding "-approval" to the user-name
&gt&gt portion of the list's address.  For instance, to contact the list owner
&gt&gt for demo-list@harlequin.com, you would send mail to demo-list-approval@harlequin.com.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt To get another copy of this help message, send mail to Majordomo@harlequin.com
&gt&gt with a line saying
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt help
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt in the message body.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt VIII. COMMAND SUMMARY FOR ADVANCED USERS
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt In the description below items contained in []'s are optional. When
&gt&gt providing the item, do not include the []'s around it.  Items in angle
&gt&gt brackets, such as &lt;address&gt, are meta-symbols that should be replaced
&gt&gt by appropriate text without the angle brackets.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt It understands the following commands:
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt     subscribe &lt;list&gt [&lt;address&gt]
&gt&gt Subscribe yourself (or &lt;address&gt if specified) to the named &lt;list&gt.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt     unsubscribe &lt;list&gt [&lt;address&gt]
&gt&gt Unsubscribe yourself (or &lt;address&gt if specified) from the named &lt;list&gt.
&gt&gt "unsubscribe *" will remove you (or &lt;address&gt) from all lists.  This
&gt&gt _may not_ work if you have subscribed using multiple addresses.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt     get &lt;list&gt &lt;filename&gt
&gt&gt         Get a file related to &lt;list&gt.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt     index &lt;list&gt
&gt&gt         Return an index of files you can "get" for &lt;list&gt.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt     which [&lt;address&gt]
&gt&gt Find out which lists you (or &lt;address&gt if specified) are on.
&gt&gt

&gt&gt 
&gt&gt     intro &lt;list&gt
&gt&gt Retrieve the introductory message sent to new users.  Non-subscribers
&gt&gt may not be able to retrieve this.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt     lists
&gt&gt Show the lists served by this Majordomo server.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt     help
&gt&gt Retrieve this message.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt     end
&gt&gt Stop processing commands (useful if your mailer adds a signature).
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt Commands should be sent in the body of an email message to
&gt&gt "Majordomo@harlequin.com". Multiple commands can be processed provided
&gt&gt each occurs on a separate line.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt Commands in the "Subject:" line are NOT processed.
&gt&gt 
&gt&gt If you have any questions or problems, please contact
