                <h1>Hot-Tracked Appearance</h1>
                <pre>Dave, Arthur, thanks for your help - I would never have thought of looking
in Deliver to find the application icon slot.

I have one more question about Lispworks: is it possible, under CAPI, to
create toolbar buttons with a hot-tracked appearance?  For example, let's
say you're using Window's Explore under Windows 2000 and you move your
pointer over the history button in the toolbar.  The history button is
originally in a neutral color, but once the pointer moves over it, the
border is raised and a color representation is used. Is something like that
available?

PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br>
<br>
The PACT Center at Carnegie Mellon University is conducting research
on cognitive tutors for high school and middle school mathematics.
Each of these tutors<br>
o is based on advanced research in artificial intelligence,<br>
&nbsp; cognitive psychology, and education,<br>
o provides students with rich problem solving activities, and<br>
o rather than multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blank questions<br>
&nbsp; offers students individualized step-by-step guidance as
needed,<br>
&nbsp; based on a cognitive model of student knowledge.<br>
<br>
PACT Center cognitive tutors for high school mathematics are now in
use in more than 700 schools nationwide and have resulted in higher
student achievement and increased retention in the academic math
sequence in both inner city and suburban high schools.<br>
<br>
We are currently embarking on a project to develop an authoring
environment, based on end-user computing techniques, that will greatly
facilitate the development of the cognitive models used in these
tutors. The tools will be suitable for use by cognitive modelers
without an extensive programming background. A first suite of these
tools will be built around our current Lisp-based Tutor Development
Kit (TDK).<br>
<br>
<br>
PROGRAMMING POSITION: LISP EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE AUTHORING TOOLS<br>
<br>
A full-time programmer is currently needed to assume responsibility
for programming the authoring tools. This involves the development of
GUI tools that interface with the TDK production rule engine, for
supporting activities in the design, testing, and debugging of
cognitive models. Additional tasks will include doing user studies of
the developed tools with users of varying levels of cognitive modeling
experience.<br>
<br>
BS or equivalent in cognitive science, cognitive psychology or
computer science and LISP programming experience are required.&nbsp;
Experience in HCI techniques for user studies, in programming
inter-process communications, or in cognitive science research,
research programming or mathematics education is desirable. Experience
in Java GUI programming an optional extra.<br>
<br>
The initial appointment is until September 30, 2002, but an additional
year is anticipated.&nbsp; We are looking to hire
immediately.</font><br>
