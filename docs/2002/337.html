                <pre>To the Xanalys developers. You were talking about if people were
willing to pay for sources and in what sources they are
interested. May I ask what you are thinking about it now?

To all the potential fans of the LispWorks source code:

It is on the agenda but it is too early to say when and what parts of
the code will be published as we want to make sure that you will get
something useful.

It should happen this year and we will surely announce it here first.

Thanks to everybody for their input. We need requests like this for our
future releases of LispWorks.
