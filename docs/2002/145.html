                <h1>CAPI Menu item</h1>
                <pre>I'm a beginner and I'm working through the CAPI User Guide for Lispworks 4.2
Personal.

Let's say that you want to build a menu like in Section 6.1 of the user
guide.  Is there any way to build a menu without automatically including the
"Works" menu item?  Or is that option only available upon delivery?

And another unrelated question: let's say that you're using Windows
Explorer, and you have a listing of files from a directory in the broad pane
to the right.  Ok, now in the narrow pane on the left you probably have a
collection of directories,  "My Computer," "My Network," and the "Recycle
Bin."  Let's say I want to delete a file, one way to do it is to drag the
name of the file from the right pane and drop it over the "Recycle Bin;"
when
you drag it, the name's outline (or contents if your settings are set right)
can be seen.  Can I do this sort of manipulation using CAPI?

I have a strong feeling that I will have to learn COM (I know nothing about
this technology) in order to do any kind of "Microsoft Office"-like GUI
programming in Windows. Is this what you all use COM in Lispworks for (like
that
drag-and-drop stuff I described earlier) ?
