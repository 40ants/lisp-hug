                <h1>A new version of my lw-commands stuff, and a question</h1>
                <pre>In case anyone is interested I put up a new version of my
lw-commands.lisp file which both lets you define new colon commands
for LW and provides a fair slew of them itself.  It's at
http://www.tfeb.org/lisp/implementation-hax#LW-COLON-COMMANDS.  It's
completely undocumented, but the most interesting new things it has
are:

    :&amp; &lt;form&gt -- makes a new process and runs &lt;form&gt in it.

    :require &lt;module&gt -- do elaborate searching for &lt;module&gt.

The :require command is also available as the function
(org.tfeb.lw-commands:require-module ...), and there is a search list
and a semi-documented (and probably semi-working!) search algorithm. A
typical search list might be:

    ((:host "CLEY-LIB"
      :directory (:absolute "MODULES")
      :name "*-LOADER"
      :type "LISP"))

- this is given in this listy form to avoid issues of logical
hosts not yet existing when images get dumped - CLEY-LIB gets defined
by our site init. The end result is that something like:

    :require :com.cley.weld

or equivalently

    (org.tfeb.lw-commands:require-module "COM.CLEY.WELD")

will find CLEY-LIB:MODULES;COM;CLEY;WELD;WELD-LOADER and load it,
expecting that it will provide the "COM.CLEY.WELD" feature.  It will
also look in a bunch of other places like
CLEY-LIB:MODULES;COM;CLEY;WELD-LOADER - the search algorithm is fairly
hairy.

Anyway, maybe it's useful to someone.

The question is: is there any reliable way of loading a system defined
with DEFSYSTEM, and then forgetting the system definition?  I do this
like this:

    (let ((systems (scm:all-systems)))
      ... define and load new systems ...
      (dolist (new (set-difference (scm:all-systems) systems 
                                   :key #'scm:module-name))
        (lw:delete-system new)))

And this works, but if the system browser is open at the point where
you do this it has a fairly major seizure.

The reason I want to do this is that I have huge things with many
systems in them, which I'm trying to load as libraries, and I don't
want to clutter up the system browser with system definitions which
aren't useful (for instance there are no sources where the library
came from).

Thanks

Yes, can you tell me how to do this? I mean: I can implement the
command, but I'm not sure what I need to change to actually change
LW's idea of the directory.  It doesn't seem to be
*DEFAULT-PATHNAME-DEFAULTS*...

Thanks

HCL:CD perhaps?

OK, there's a new version with :cd, :pwd, :pushd, :popd and :dirs.
They may even work.  the directory stack is not thread-local as I
don't think the working directory is (this is as opposed to the
package stack, which is thread-local).
