                <h1>Oracle</h1>
                <pre>I would like to connect to an Oracle database with LWL Entreprise on a
Debian box.
I searched with google but I couldn't find what libraries are needed for
this connection.
So are some shared libraries needed or can I connect directly from LWL ?
If I need libraries, where can I find Debian Woody compatible ones ?

Thanks

Marc

Thanks. 
Looks like I will have to download the 3 Oracle 9 CDs to get them :-(

                  <h1>Bug or misuse?</h1>
                  <pre>I used the function directory today. And found
a) the keyword :check-for-subs is not longer valid for directory
b) :directories does nothing?

I have this files in /tmp
ls -ld *
drwx------    2 frido    frido          48 25. Nov 13:18 frido/
drwx------    2 frido    frido          72 25. Nov 06:42 gsrvdir1000/
drwx------    2 frido    frido         528 25. Nov 08:16 orbit-frido/
-rw-------    1 root     root            0 25. Nov 07:04 session_mm_apache0.sem


Now 
(directory "/tmp/" :directories t) 

CL-USER 95 &gt (directory "/tmp/" :directories t)
(#P"/var/tmp/.sawfish-frido/"
 #P"/var/tmp/.vmware/"
 #P"/var/tmp/session_mm_apache0.sem"
 #P"/var/tmp/.X11-unix/"
 #P"/var/tmp/.X0-lock"
 #P"/var/tmp/frido/"
 #P"/var/tmp/orbit-frido/"
 #P"/var/tmp/.ICE-unix/"
 #P"/var/tmp/gsrvdir1000/")

 (directory "/tmp/" :directories nil)
(#P"/var/tmp/.sawfish-frido/"
 #P"/var/tmp/.vmware/"
 #P"/var/tmp/session_mm_apache0.sem"
 #P"/var/tmp/.X11-unix/"
 #P"/var/tmp/.X0-lock"
 #P"/var/tmp/frido/"
 #P"/var/tmp/orbit-frido/"
 #P"/var/tmp/.ICE-unix/"
 #P"/var/tmp/gsrvdir1000/")

That's the same!

Now really funny:
 (directory "/tmp" :directories t)
(#P"/user/"
 #P"/opt/"
....

show all the files a level higher....

If I try:

(directory "/tmp/t1" :directories t)

I got this:
(#P"/var/tmp/.sawfish-frido/"
 #P"/var/tmp/.vmware/"
 #P"/var/tmp/.X11-unix/"
 #P"/var/tmp/frido/"
 #P"/var/tmp/orbit-frido/"
 #P"/var/tmp/.ICE-unix/"
 #P"/var/tmp/gsrvdir1000/")

This seems all a bit strange to me. Is this supposed to be correct?
My system is a Debian/Linux LW 4.2.7

Do I have to write my own test function to check if it's a Directory
or not?

Well thanks for you answer, I filed a bug-report because I would think
this would be a bug. I was probably wrong about that, I than would
suggest that this is mentioned in the documentation.

&gt 
&gt Ways to exclude the directories include
&gt 
&gt (DIRECTORY "/tmp/" :test 'PATHNAME-NAME)
Well this is weird and not very user friendly IMHO:
&gt 
&gt LispWorks also has the function FILE-DIRECTORY-P.
I know and used it for listing dirctories.

Thanks for taking the time answering.

Friedrich
