                <h1>MOP metaclass extensibility question</h1>
                <pre>I am using the Linux Personal Edition of Lispworks to evaluate
Lispwork's current MOP capabilities.  Specifically, I'm looking into
the ability to use the MOP to create specialized
direct-slot-definition objects based on the use of an extended
defclass slot option; silly e.g.:

  (defclass test ()
    ((regular :initform 3)
     (extended :extended-slot t :initform 4))
    (:metaclass extended-class))

  (defmethod clos:direct-slot-definition-class ((class extended-class)
                                               initargs)
  (if (getf initargs :extended-slot)
      'extended-direct-slot-definition
      (call-next-method)))

where extended-class is a subclass of standard-class and
extended-direct-slot-definition is a subclass of
standard-direct-slot-definition.

The problem I'm having is that Lispwork's
canonicalize-defstruct-slot complains about the extended slot
option before the protocol gets to determining/initializing the
slot-definition object.  Is there a Lispwork's idiom supporting
this type of metaclass extensibility or am I at a dead end?
Any advice is greatly appreciated--especially as a Personal
Edition (trial) user who is not yet a paying customer...

I've used (a variant of) the code below to solve the problem you mention.
You can use a similar around-method for clos::canonicalize-class-options.
This is probably not the official way, but It Works For Me.

While we're on the subject of the MOP, I'd like to make two requests to
Xanalys:

  1. I find Lispworks' behaviour with canonicalize-defstruct-slot and
     canonicalize-class-options rather annoying. I would appreciate it
     if there were some way to turn the errors off. That would also
     be better compatible with the AMOP (The Art of the Metaobject
     Protocol) and with other Lisp implementations like Allegro CL 
     and CMUCL (I think; I never tested this).

  2. More generally, I would really appreciate some documentation of 
     Lispworks' way of handling the MOP. I would expect at least a 
     description of all places where Lispworks deviates from AMOP.

Thanks,

Arthur Lemmens
