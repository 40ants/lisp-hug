                <h1>[Q] Accessing the system clipboard</h1>
                <pre>Hello,

Is there a platform neutral way to get and set the contents of the
system clipboard in LispWorks? If so, what is it? :) and will that
also side-effect the kill-ring of all the open editor panes?

Thanks.

This was exactly what I was looking for. Thanks.

&gt
&gt (CAPI:CLIPBOARD &lt;pane&gt)
&gt
&gt (CAPI:SET-CLIPBOARD &lt;pane&gt "the contents of the system clipboard")
&gt
&gt
&gt                                                         and will that

&gt
&gt
&gt Yes, since the Editor by default uses the clipboard in its Un-Kill
&gt command (on Ctrl+Y in Emacs emulation). You can switch this Editor
&gt behaviour off completely by
&gt
&gt  (SETF EDITOR:*INTERPROGRAM-PASTE-FUNCTION* NIL)
&gt
&gt or avoid it for a particular use of Un-Kill by using the prefix
&gt argument: Ctrl+U Ctrl+Y.

I was looking through old mail to find a solution to this, but
in 4.2.7 capi:clipboard seems to demand a second parameter...?

&gt This will get the system clipboard:
&gt 
&gt (CAPI:CLIPBOARD &lt;pane&gt :STRING)
&gt 
&gt CAPI:SET-CLIPBOARD is OK as above.

Great! Just one more question: This works great in the Windows version,
but in the linux version, the contents of the clipboard aren't
transferred to the X clipboard (like they are if I e.g. use the Copy
menu item in the editor).

&gt Perhaps my mistake was due to wishful thinking,

&gt There's also CAPI:SELECTION and CAPI:SET-SELECTION which sets the
&gt primary selection on X. Does that DTRT for you?

yes! That seems to do the trick.

&gt We do need to straighten out these APIs. 

yes, please :-)
