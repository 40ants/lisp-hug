                <pre>Julian,

Thanks. I confirmed that these instructions still work at least as far as 
fetching a file containing all the subject headers of the archived 
messages. The only change that needed to be made, as you indicated, was 
using @xanalys.com in place of @harlequin.com.

Regards,

-ram

&gt
&gt
&gt&gt Sorry if this is an oft asked question, but is this mailing list archived
&gt
&gt Don't worry, it is not an oft asked question.
&gt
&gt Below are the instructions emailed to me when I signed up. They include
&gt commands to get the archive. I emailed these to someone else about a month
&gt ago who wanted the archive and he confirmed to me that it still works. I
&gt have no idea if all the other functionality described below still works 
&gt however.
&gt The email below was from the time before the transition of Harlequin to
&gt Xanalys was complete so be careful to substitute xanalys.com  instead of
&gt harlequin.com as the domain names for all email adresses below.
&gt
&gt Hope that helps,
