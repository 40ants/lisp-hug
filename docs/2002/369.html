                <h1>some features</h1>
                <pre>I was used to work with Allegro CL and now I moved to LispWorks for Windows.
I'm missing a few features, and I'd like to know if it's possible to obtain
them in LispWorks:

1. How can I make the GUI debugger appear automatically every time there is
a bug (without having to press the debug button)?

2. I want the editor and listener to indent all lines automatically (without
having to press TAB each line). How can that be done?

3. In ACL, pressing Ctrl+: toggels between adding ";;; " to the beginning of
a line and removing it. In LispWorks I only managed to add ";;;; " by adding
(editor:bind-key "Comment Region" "Control-:")
to msw-key-binds.lisp. Is there a way to make Control-: (or another key
combination) make the comment prefix disappear? Is there a way to make the
comment add only three ";" instead of four?

4. What is the most convenient way to search for a string in all the files
under a directory? And in all the files that belong to a system (which is
defined with defsystem)?

5. In a file defsys.lisp that I wrote (containing my defsystem from), I
added 
(eval-when (:load-toplevel)
  (compile-system 'mysys)
  (load-system 'mysys))
so that when I load the file, the entire system will be compiled if needed
and loaded. One of the files in the system defines a package called "MAIN".
What can I write in defsys.lisp so that the listener will switch to that
package? (in-package :main) under the eval-when didn't have that effect.

6. Is there a command to invoke the GUI inspector on some value instead of
the TTY inspector?

7. I succeeded in building an interface with CAPI. 
a. (format t ...) in a callback function writes to the output buffer. How do
I write to the listener instead?
b. How do I invoke the GUI inspector on some value from a callback function?


Another comment: I suggest that in all your html documentations, you add a
link to the cover page of all documentation manuals (C:\Program
Files\Xanalys\LispWorks\lib\4-2-0-0\manual\online\intro.htm) to facilitate
moving between them. Otherwise, one needs to go to the LispWork help menu
and select the desired manual.

There is precisely such a file. I don't have LW installed at home, but I believe
it's somewhere like

       manual\online\index.html  (or maybe .htm)

I'll answer (some) others tomorrow when I'm in a position to test my answers, if
nobody else has got there first.

(setf *enter-debugger-directly* t)

This (and other useful bits) is documented (somewhat) in the file:

[lispworks-dir]/lib/4-2-0-0/config/configure.lisp

&gt 2. I want the editor and listener to indent all lines automatically (without

(bind-key "Indent New Line" #\Return)

Use the "Grep Browser" from the "Tools" menu.

Or you can use the tags commands in the editor:

M-x "Find Source" (bound to \M-.)
M-x "Find Tag"
M-x "Continue Tags Search" (bound to \M-,)

&gt 6. Is there a command to invoke the GUI inspector on some value instead of
&gt the TTY inspector?

(environment:display-inspector :object foo)

e.g.:

(environment:display-inspector :object '(a b c))

&gt b. How do I invoke the GUI inspector on some value from a callback function?

See previous answer.

Couldn't you just make a bookmark/favorite in your browser of choice?
