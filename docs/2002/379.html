                <h1>Really exit the windowing environment?</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

I've written a HTTP server with a simple CAPI interface.
When I shutdown the computer, Windows tries to close the program.
At that moment, a popup-window appears, asking "Do you really want
to exit the windowing environment?". I suppose this is a message
from CAPI. This does not happen when I close the program manually 
(e.g. by pressing Alt-F4 or by clicking on the little cross in
the top right of the title bar).

Does anyone know how I can tell CAPI that I don't want this popup-
window to appear, and that, yes, I really want to exit the windowing
environment?

(I'm using LWW 4.2.6 Professional.)

Thanks a lot,

Arthur Lemmens

&gt Perhaps there should be some proper control over this behaviour. For

It does indeed.
Thank you very much!
