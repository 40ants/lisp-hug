                <h1>Did anybody compile CL-HTTP recently?</h1>
                <pre>Hi!

I am trying to compile the release version of CL-HTTP with
LispWorks 4.2 for Linux.  But I keep getting lots of error messages
like

; MINIPROC:PROCESS-WAIT
; MINIPROC:PROCESS-WAIT-WITH-TIMEOUT
; MINIPROC:PROCESS-SLEEP
; MINIPROC:WITHOUT-SCHEDULING


**++++ Error between functions:
  Defining macro WITHOUT-SCHEDULING visible from package CLIM-SYS.
; MINIPROC:MAKE-LOCK
; MINIPROC:MAKE-RECURSIVE-LOCK
; MINIPROC:WITH-LOCK-HELD
; MINIPROC:WITH-RECURSIVE-LOCK-HELD
; MINIPROC:ATOMIC-INCF
; MINIPROC:ATOMIC-DECF
; (TOP-LEVEL-FORM 7)
; *** 1 error detected, no fasl file produced.

when I try to load start.lisp.  Does anybody know what to make of
this?  Should it work?  Should one take the development version of
CL-HTTP instead?

Regards,

The development version compiles just fine...

Sorry,

&gt 
&gt Do you have CLIM loaded?

I tried both with and without clim.  Had no effect.

&gt With LispWorks 4.1 and the current release of CL-HTTP there are a few
&gt problems related to the imports of symbols from the MP package when
&gt CLIM is loaded.  About two summers ago a patch I submitted for this
&gt was incorporated into the development version of CL-HTTP.
&gt 
&gt Fortunately, the latest development version of CL-HTTP does works just
&gt fine with LispWorks 4.2.

Yes, seems so.  I'll play around with it for a while.

&gt  Unfortunately, there is some ugly stuff going on during
&gt initialization when CL-HTTP tries to determine the DNS domain name
&gt of your machine.  Specifically, there is some seriously losing code
&gt in lw/server/unix.lisp which calls getdomainname() to obtain this
&gt information.  Clearly, this is a complete misunderstanding as
&gt getdomainname() returns the YP domain of your machine, which only
&gt coincidentally may be in any way related to your DNS domain name.
&gt 
&gt You can hack around this by making WWW-UTILS:DEFAULT-DOMAIN-NAME
&gt function as it does on the MCL port.

Thanks for the warning :-)
