                <h1>ensure-area-visible</h1>
                <pre>According to the CAPI documentation, ensure-area-visible ”… works only for subclasses of simple-pane that do internal scrolling (such as editor-pane). An error is signalled if it is called with other classes.”

But what about output-panes? An error is certainly not signalled, and the function seems to work correctly *most of the time*. But is this actually supported, or is it just ”a coincidence”? Or is it dependent on whether the output-pane has ordinary or internal scrolling?

Regards
Erik

It can be used for any instances of output-pane or layout that have at least
one scroll bar.  We will correct the documentation.
