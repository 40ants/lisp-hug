<p>Hello All,</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>I've been contemplating the possibility of writing an IDE for Lisp. I know that most Lisp developers use emacs, but try as I might, I have never been able to enjoy using it. I spend a fair amount of time using Visual Studio, so that could well be a factor.
 Anyway, I have been wanting a more traditional IDE (in the other language sense) for some time now. I sorely miss certain IDE features when programming in Lisp. Things like a snippet library, code completion, code folding, etc.. One major feature I would like
 to have is the ability to target multiple remote images. I would probably use Qt and QScintilla as a starting point. I'm posting this because I was wondering if there was anyone else who would be interested in such a thing? If I knew that there was interest,
 I would probably make different choices when developing the project. I would also be interested in hearing everyone's thoughts on the topic in general. I most certainly don't mean to offend anyone who is using other tools or start some kind of holy war. I'm
 just trying to find out if there are any like minded individuals out there..<br>

<p>Hi Sean,</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>I guess I'm not the typical case of the frustrated emacs user. I started using emacs on an OS call Xenix. I was forced to use it for several years, so I learned the keystrokes etc.. It never felt right to me.&nbsp;I know it has had improvements&nbsp;since then, but&nbsp;I
 still&nbsp;prefer&nbsp;the more&nbsp;VS&nbsp;like&nbsp;IDE.&nbsp;I&nbsp;do respect&nbsp;it, and I&nbsp;can&nbsp;imagine how&nbsp;some folks&nbsp;could like it a lot. I'm just more productive&nbsp;with other tools.&nbsp;I plan to&nbsp;use&nbsp;minimalist C&#43;&#43;&nbsp;and Qt. Qt is a rich cross-platform gui toolkit, which provides a lot of stuff
 out of the box. I am also planning to use QScintilla for the editor. A nice editor component, which also provides some good stuff out of the box. I can't really think of a better alternative to those two for a quick start.<br>

<div>I ask that because LISP might not be the best cross-platform GUI providing solution... perhaps Clojure would do the job coupled with say J4GL... if you are going to write a good UI ight as well go game-level on it, that was my plan!</div>

<p>Hi Steven,<br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>I hear you and you are right. It is a daunting task. It's just that I recently realized that I could continue dreaming or actually start doing something about it. My initial goal would be fairly modest. I would just try to get a syntax highlighting editor
 going with some kind of project based file management. I'd force myself to use it exclusively, so that I would continue to be motivated. I plan to&nbsp;dedicate a certain amount of time each week to the project. I really don't know where&nbsp;it could end up at this&nbsp;point.
 The remote image thing would be a very high priority though. Never the less,&nbsp;Rome wasn't&nbsp;built in a day as it were&nbsp;;-) Thanks for your response.

<p>Hi Rainer,</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>I have used the LispWorks IDE for a few years now. I was trying to avoid criticizing&nbsp;it here, because&nbsp;I&nbsp;feel like it would be disrespectful&nbsp;on a&nbsp;list dedicated to &quot;LispWorks&quot;.&nbsp;I think&nbsp;the&nbsp;LispWorks folks&nbsp;have done a commendable&nbsp;job on their IDE.&nbsp;Having said
 that,&nbsp;as with&nbsp;all things, you can't please everyone.&nbsp;Unfortunately, I find myself unable to get completely comfortable with it. I guess when I'm switching back and forth between different IDEs (Visual Studio, QtCreator), LispWorks ends up feeling a little
 cumbersome. I mainly use Linux for Lisp development, so maybe that would&nbsp;matter for&nbsp;my case. I whole heartedly agree with you on the less is more aspect though. I want a lean, smooth, fast environment that gets out of the way. I think I would end up writing
 a lot more lisp code, if I had an IDE like that. I am more than happy to give up some functionality for anything close to the lean, smooth, fast feel.. I do feel that all IDE windows and features should be a configuration option. I like IDEs that let me git
 rid of the stuff that I don't want. I'm definitely not a Java kind of guy and I don't care much for any of that world (even though I've been forced into it a few times). Have you seen QtCreator and other apps written with Qt? What are your thoughts about those
 apps? I've looked around quite a bit and I haven't been able to come up with a better choice than Qt so far. My current Lisp development environment is Sublime Text and a terminal with a&nbsp;REPL ;-). I've&nbsp;used the LispWorks&nbsp;IDE for&nbsp;debugging a couple of times,
 but I don't need it very often (even though it is pretty cool).<br>

<div></div>
<div>Remember that the LispWorks IDE is already cross platform and comes with an Emacs-like editor. Note also that LispWorks comes with the source code for the editor.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>It is also useful to give feedback to the LispWorks developers, since it may help them to see which features would help and integrate it into the product with new versions.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Personally LispWorks is my first choice for writing Lisp code and also some other editing tasks. I have GNU Emacs and also the Aquamacs variant of GNU Emacs.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>I like the light-weight editing in LispWorks and the look&amp;feel on the Mac. One can easily add too much visual clutter and too much functionality to an editor. Do we really need code folding? I never use that in GNU Emacs. I don't even need paredit or similar.
 What I use is the s-expression based commands in LispWorks and the mouse support, incl. mouse copy.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>What I would prefer is slick look &amp; feel. Smooth scrolling, nice fonts, more visual UI for the editor in menus (there are some useful extended commands which are hard to find), quick command overviews, I would like to be able to have all information in
 editor windows clickable (like the external format -&gt; click on it to change it), some improvements in error handling for example when using unicode formats, etc.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>I think usability is very important and sometimes less is more. I don't need much syntax highlighting and some people were reporting improvements turning it off in their IDEs.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>In the Java-World there are big IDEs like Netbeans, Eclipse and IntelliJ. They have much more features than just for Java development. Even though they have lots of useful features which could be reused, I would not like to use them for Lisp development.</div>
<div>It's also that I don't like their visual appearance. They don't look slick and native. They have too many distractions and I don't like the multi-multi-pane window layouts...</div>

<div>I ask that because LISP might not be the best cross-platform GUI providing solution... perhaps Clojure would do the job coupled with say J4GL... if you are going to write a good UI ight as well go game-level on it, that was my plan!</div>

<p>Hi Steven,<br>

</p>
<p>I hear you and you are right. It is a daunting task. It's just that I recently realized that I could continue dreaming or actually start doing something about it. My initial goal would be fairly modest. I would just try to get a syntax highlighting editor
 going with some kind of project based file management. I'd force myself to use it exclusively, so that I would continue to be motivated. I plan to&nbsp;dedicate a certain amount of time each week to the project. I really don't know where&nbsp;it could end up at this&nbsp;point.
 The remote image thing would be a very high priority though. Never the less,&nbsp;Rome wasn't&nbsp;built in a day as it were&nbsp;;-) Thanks for your response.

 want.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12.0pt; color:black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12.0pt; color:black">I've been contemplating the possibility of writing an IDE for Lisp. I know that most Lisp developers use emacs, but try as I might, I have never been able to enjoy using it. I spend a fair amount of time using
 Visual Studio, so that could well be a factor. Anyway, I have been wanting a more traditional IDE (in the other language sense) for some time now. I sorely miss certain IDE features when programming in Lisp. Things like a snippet library, code completion,
 code folding, etc.. One major feature I would like to have is the ability to target multiple remote images. I would probably use Qt and QScintilla as a starting point. I'm posting this because I was wondering if there was anyone else who would be interested
 in such a thing? If I knew that there was interest, I would probably make different choices when developing the project. I would also be interested in hearing everyone's thoughts on the topic in general. I most certainly don't mean to offend anyone who is
 using other tools or start some kind of holy war. I'm just trying to find out if there are any like minded individuals out there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12.0pt;color:black">I have used the LispWorks IDE for a few years now. I was trying to avoid criticizing&nbsp;it here, because&nbsp;I&nbsp;feel like it would be disrespectful&nbsp;on a&nbsp;list dedicated to &quot;LispWorks&quot;.&nbsp;I think&nbsp;the&nbsp;LispWorks folks&nbsp;have done
 a commendable&nbsp;job on their IDE.&nbsp;Having said that,&nbsp;as with&nbsp;all things, you can't please everyone.&nbsp;Unfortunately, I find myself unable to get completely comfortable with it. I guess when I'm switching back and forth between different IDEs (Visual Studio, QtCreator),
 LispWorks ends up feeling a little cumbersome. I mainly use Linux for Lisp development, so maybe that would&nbsp;matter for&nbsp;my case. I whole heartedly agree with you on the less is more aspect though. I want a lean, smooth, fast environment that gets out of the
 way. I think I would end up writing a lot more lisp code, if I had an IDE like that. I am more than happy to give up some functionality for anything close to the lean, smooth, fast feel. I do feel that all IDE windows and features should be a configuration
 option. I like IDEs that let me git rid of the stuff that I don't want. I'm definitely not a Java kind of guy and I don't care much for any of that world (even though I've been forced into it a few times). Have you seen QtCreator and other apps written with
 Qt? What are your thoughts about those apps? I've looked around quite a bit and I haven't been able to come up with a better choice than Qt so far. My current Lisp development environment is Sublime Text and a terminal with a&nbsp;REPL ;-). I've&nbsp;used the LispWorks&nbsp;IDE
 for&nbsp;debugging a couple of times, but I don't need it very often (even though it is pretty cool).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="background:white"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;color:black">I've been contemplating the possibility of writing an IDE for Lisp. I know that most Lisp developers use emacs, but try as I might, I have never been able to enjoy using it. I spend a fair
 amount of time using Visual Studio, so that could well be a factor. Anyway, I have been wanting a more traditional IDE (in the other language sense) for some time now. I sorely miss certain IDE features when programming in Lisp. Things like a snippet library,
 code completion, code folding, etc.. One major feature I would like to have is the ability to target multiple remote images. I would probably use Qt and QScintilla as a starting point. I'm posting this because I was wondering if there was anyone else who would
 be interested in such a thing? If I knew that there was interest, I would probably make different choices when developing the project. I would also be interested in hearing everyone's thoughts on the topic in general. I most certainly don't mean to offend
 anyone who is using other tools or start some kind of holy war. I'm just trying to find out if there are any like minded individuals out there.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;color:#212121"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>Hi Steven,</p>

</p>
<p>Yes. I have tried it. I was actually going to look into&nbsp;whether&nbsp;it would be&nbsp;practical to write a C&#43;&#43; client for swank. Although, the setup was pretty fiddly. I'm definitely going to use it as a reference though. One thing I really want is the ability to
 send the current editor buffer contents to headless remote images and deploy images to remote machines from the IDE.<br>

<p><span style="font-size:12.0pt; color:black">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:12.0pt; color:black">I have used the LispWorks IDE for a few years now. I was trying to avoid criticizing&nbsp;it here, because&nbsp;I&nbsp;feel like it would be disrespectful&nbsp;on a&nbsp;list dedicated to &quot;LispWorks&quot;.&nbsp;I think&nbsp;the&nbsp;LispWorks folks&nbsp;have done
 a commendable&nbsp;job on their IDE.&nbsp;Having said that,&nbsp;as with&nbsp;all things, you can't please everyone.&nbsp;Unfortunately, I find myself unable to get completely comfortable with it. I guess when I'm switching back and forth between different IDEs (Visual Studio, QtCreator),
 LispWorks ends up feeling a little cumbersome. I mainly use Linux for Lisp development, so maybe that would&nbsp;matter for&nbsp;my case. I whole heartedly agree with you on the less is more aspect though. I want a lean, smooth, fast environment that gets out of the
 way. I think I would end up writing a lot more lisp code, if I had an IDE like that. I am more than happy to give up some functionality for anything close to the lean, smooth, fast feel. I do feel that all IDE windows and features should be a configuration
 option. I like IDEs that let me git rid of the stuff that I don't want. I'm definitely not a Java kind of guy and I don't care much for any of that world (even though I've been forced into it a few times). Have you seen QtCreator and other apps written with
 Qt? What are your thoughts about those apps? I've looked around quite a bit and I haven't been able to come up with a better choice than Qt so far. My current Lisp development environment is Sublime Text and a terminal with a&nbsp;REPL ;-). I've&nbsp;used the LispWorks&nbsp;IDE
 for&nbsp;debugging a couple of times, but I don't need it very often (even though it is pretty cool).</span></p>

 I never use that in GNU Emacs. I don't even need paredit or similar. What I use is the s-expression based commands in LispWorks and the mouse support, incl. mouse copy.</span></p>

                 <pre>I was thinking about this whole editor thread last night. I am really annoyed with GNU emacs too, and would love to have an non-commercial alternative. The trouble is, I think, the 'lisp curse' more than anything else. We (lispers, collectively), really need to focus on community building more than software building.

Climbing down from the soapbox, perhaps contributing / reviving an existing editor project is the best way forward? I had a look again at Dylan Deuce and it seems like a good target. The editor has a good pedigree (in that it was designed and built by some ex-Symbolics folks), is a 3rd gen design and it seems DUIM was ported to common-lisp by Duncan Rose.

Subject: Re: Potential IDE project

Hi all!

I'm slowly developing my Lisp IDE for about 2 years already. I tried to "advertise" it in 2015, but received nearly zero feedback, so I translated most of its parts to Russian and stopped further advertising.

Key components are:
1. SWANK. Hence we have most of tools which present in SLIME (some with lower quality, some are better than in SLIME).

2. Some lisp-specific editing commands are borrowed from the fork of EMACS-like HEMLOCK editor, so knows something about CL. E.g. there is "indent sexp" command.

3. Written in a client-server architecture. Server is your lisp image (with IDE server sources loaded), client is a separate GUI application written in tcl/tk. Initially I tried to use tk wrappers for tcl, but quickly rejected that. Writing client in pure tcl is much easier and allows to use all tk components. Wrappers suggest rather narrow set of widgets and anyway when problems arise, you have to learn tcl/tk. Also there are some more or less "debuggers" for tcl, which allow to diagnose things with ease.

4. Permissively licensed.

Site is here https://bitbucket.org/budden/clcon_en , but it contains nothing essential today.
Main branch is here: https://bitbucket.org/budden/clcon

Some screenshots are here
https://bitbucket.org/budden/clcon/wiki/Screenshots (some old, some in Russian).

Generally, everything is still in deep alpha quality, but I use the environment on a daily basis and almost never use EMACS.

Main current features are:

- supports only SBCL. Some effort is needed to port
- tested under Windows and sometimes under Linux
- every tool is in its own Window - like Lispworks IDE
- no minibuffer, REPL is used instead to enter complex editor commands not listed in menu (no command completion yet)
- multi-tabbed text editor with notepad-like look and feel
- some lisp navigation commands (next/previous sexp, up sexp, mark sexp)
- support of (in-readtable) form (missing in SLIME)
- REPL with persistent history and search through the history
- find in files with mutliple result windows (missing in EMACS)
- go to definition
- go to package definition, go to asd system definition (better than in EMACS)
- inspector
- debugger (stack, locals, inspect locals, eval in frame, return from frame, invoke restart)
- thread list (with debug)
- integration with cl-hyperdoc
- compilation error browser, errors are sorted by severity (seem to be missing in EMACS)
- list of definitions in the file (some quick hack with regexp)

I can say definitely that "clcon" is incomparably more advanced than ABLE and LispIDE. It is weaker than Lispworks on EMACS. I never seen slimv, jabberwocky and so on.

Most of UI and some portions of source code are now in Russian, but if actual collaborator would appear, I can fix that and prepare English version.

I'm spending a very little resource on the development in a last year, but some things are to be done:
- fix race conditions in the editor (some work is done, but more to do)
- support CCL
- improve performance of matching paren highlight
- find and replace in files
- automatic window placement
- multiple editor windows (for now we have "open in another editor" menu item)
- auto-completion for editor commands
- improve editor bookmarks (now they are just prototype)
- IDE programmer's guide (just add more examples indeed)
- finish inspector GUI (now it misses some essential things)

&gt&gt
&gt&gt Yes. I have tried it. I was actually going to look into whether it 
&gt&gt would be practical to write a C++ client for swank. Although, the 
&gt&gt setup was pretty fiddly. I'm definitely going to use it as a 
&gt&gt reference though. One thing I really want is the ability to send the

&gt&gt images to remote machines from the IDE.

&gt&gt
&gt&gt Hi Rainer,
&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt I have used the LispWorks IDE for a few years now. I was trying to 
&gt&gt avoid criticizing it here, because I feel like it would be 
&gt&gt disrespectful on a list dedicated to "LispWorks". I think the 
&gt&gt LispWorks folks have done a commendable job on their IDE. Having said 
&gt&gt that, as with all things, you can't please everyone. Unfortunately, I 
&gt&gt find myself unable to get completely comfortable with it. I guess 
&gt&gt when I'm switching back and forth between different IDEs (Visual 
&gt&gt Studio, QtCreator), LispWorks ends up feeling a little cumbersome. I 
&gt&gt mainly use Linux for Lisp development, so maybe that would matter for 
&gt&gt my case. I whole heartedly agree with you on the less is more aspect 
&gt&gt though. I want a lean, smooth, fast environment that gets out of the 
&gt&gt way. I think I would end up writing a lot more lisp code, if I had an 
&gt&gt IDE like that. I am more than happy to give up some functionality for 
&gt&gt anything close to the lean, smooth, fast feel. I do feel that all IDE 
&gt&gt windows and features should be a configuration option. I like IDEs 
&gt&gt that let me git rid of the stuff that I don't want. I'm definitely 
&gt&gt not a Java kind of guy and I don't care much for any of that world 
&gt&gt (even though I've been forced into it a few times). Have you seen 
&gt&gt QtCreator and other apps written with Qt? What are your thoughts 
&gt&gt about those apps? I've looked around quite a bit and I haven't been 
&gt&gt able to come up with a better choice than Qt so far. My current Lisp 
&gt&gt development environment is Sublime Text and a terminal with a REPL 
&gt&gt ;-). I've used the LispWorks IDE for debugging a couple of times, but 
&gt&gt I don't need it very often (even though it is pretty cool).
&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt Thanks,
&gt&gt Gerry

&gt&gt
&gt&gt Remember that the LispWorks IDE is already cross platform and comes 
&gt&gt with an Emacs-like editor. Note also that LispWorks comes with the 
&gt&gt source code for the editor.
&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt It is also useful to give feedback to the LispWorks developers, since 
&gt&gt it may help them to see which features would help and integrate it 
&gt&gt into the product with new versions.
&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt Personally LispWorks is my first choice for writing Lisp code and 
&gt&gt also some other editing tasks. I have GNU Emacs and also the Aquamacs 
&gt&gt variant of GNU Emacs.
&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt I like the light-weight editing in LispWorks and the look&amp;feel on the 
&gt&gt Mac.
&gt&gt One can easily add too much visual clutter and too much functionality 
&gt&gt to an editor. Do we really need code folding? I never use that in GNU 
&gt&gt Emacs. I don't even need paredit or similar. What I use is the 
&gt&gt s-expression based commands in LispWorks and the mouse support, incl. 
&gt&gt mouse copy.
&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt What I would prefer is slick look &amp; feel. Smooth scrolling, nice 
&gt&gt fonts, more visual UI for the editor in menus (there are some useful 
&gt&gt extended commands which are hard to find), quick command overviews, I 
&gt&gt would like to be able to have all information in editor windows 
&gt&gt clickable (like the external format -&gt click on it to change it), 
&gt&gt some improvements in error handling for example when using unicode 
&gt&gt formats, etc.
&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt I think usability is very important and sometimes less is more. I 
&gt&gt don't need much syntax highlighting and some people were reporting 
&gt&gt improvements turning it off in their IDEs.
&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt In the Java-World there are big IDEs like Netbeans, Eclipse and IntelliJ.
&gt&gt They have much more features than just for Java development. Even 
&gt&gt though they have lots of useful features which could be reused, I 
&gt&gt would not like to use them for Lisp development.
&gt&gt
&gt&gt It's also that I don't like their visual appearance. They don't look 
&gt&gt slick and native. They have too many distractions and I don't like 
&gt&gt the multi-multi-pane window layouts...
&gt&gt

&gt&gt I too have been where you are. The real *truth* is that there will 
&gt&gt never be a single perfect LISP IDE because we are all different with 
&gt&gt different views, preferences etc.
&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt My cure was a simple series of steps:
&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt studying the source code for emacs!!!
&gt&gt
&gt&gt study the source code for paredit mode carefully!
&gt&gt
&gt&gt learn to use paredit mode effectively
&gt&gt
&gt&gt learn to use SLIME effectively
&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt Unless you have LW (I do but rarely use it even though it is free) 
&gt&gt and live and breathe in it, Emacs *is* the best ready to go solution IMHO...
&gt&gt you just have to really make the mental effort to learn all the short 
&gt&gt cut keystrokes for all the helpful stuff for manipulating 
&gt&gt s-expressions, navigation.
&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt All the best though, I'd certainly be interested BUT what language do we
&gt&gt write it in ?    ;)
&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt I ask that because LISP might not be the best cross-platform GUI 
&gt&gt providing solution... perhaps Clojure would do the job coupled with 
&gt&gt say J4GL... if you are going to write a good UI ight as well go 
&gt&gt game-level on it, that was my plan!
&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt :)
&gt&gt All the best!!!

&gt&gt Hi Steven,

&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt I hear you and you are right. It is a daunting task. It's just that I
&gt&gt recently realized that I could continue dreaming or actually start doing
&gt&gt something about it. My initial goal would be fairly modest. I would just
&gt&gt try to get a syntax highlighting editor going with some kind of project
&gt&gt based file management. I'd force myself to use it exclusively, so that I
&gt&gt would continue to be motivated. I plan to dedicate a certain amount of
&gt&gt time
&gt&gt each week to the project. I really don't know where it could end up at
&gt&gt this point. The remote image thing would be a very high priority though.
&gt&gt Never the less, Rome wasn't built in a day as it were ;-) Thanks for your

&gt&gt I don’t like emacs either. Perhaps you share my dislike of emacs in the
&gt&gt true sense of the word: GNU Emacs. There have been emacs-like editors
&gt&gt that
&gt&gt are very good, like xmacs for instance, that would probably be able to do
&gt&gt much of what you want.
&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt
&gt&gt The McCLIM guys were at one point trying to create such an editor, you
&gt&gt might check over there. You’ll need help, it is a monumental task.
&gt&gt There’s
&gt&gt also the Dylan editor; that might make a good starting point. I’d love to
&gt&gt see some investment, time or money, in those editors.

&gt; Climbing down from the soapbox, perhaps contributing / reviving an existing editor project is the best way forward? I had a look again at Dylan Deuce and it seems like a good target. The editor has a good pedigree (in that it was designed and built by some
 ex-Symbolics folks), is a 3rd gen design and it seems DUIM was ported to common-lisp by Duncan Rose.<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; Hi all!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I'm slowly developing my Lisp IDE for about 2 years already. I tried to &quot;advertise&quot; it in 2015, but received nearly zero feedback, so I translated most of its parts to Russian and stopped further advertising.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Key components are:<br>
&gt; 1. SWANK. Hence we have most of tools which present in SLIME (some with lower quality, some are better than in SLIME).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 2. Some lisp-specific editing commands are borrowed from the fork of EMACS-like HEMLOCK editor, so knows something about CL. E.g. there is &quot;indent sexp&quot; command.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 3. Written in a client-server architecture. Server is your lisp image (with IDE server sources loaded), client is a separate GUI application written in tcl/tk. Initially I tried to use tk wrappers for tcl, but quickly rejected that. Writing client in pure
 tcl is much easier and allows to use all tk components. Wrappers suggest rather narrow set of widgets and anyway when problems arise, you have to learn tcl/tk. Also there are some more or less &quot;debuggers&quot; for tcl, which allow to diagnose things with ease.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 4. Permissively licensed.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Site is here <a href="https://bitbucket.org/budden/clcon_en" target="_blank">https://bitbucket.org/budden/clcon_en</a> , but it contains nothing essential today.<br>
&gt; Main branch is here: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/budden/clcon" target="_blank">
https://bitbucket.org/budden/clcon</a><br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Some screenshots are here<br>
&gt; <a href="https://bitbucket.org/budden/clcon/wiki/Screenshots" target="_blank">https://bitbucket.org/budden/clcon/wiki/Screenshots</a> (some old, some in Russian).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Generally, everything is still in deep alpha quality, but I use the environment on a daily basis and almost never use EMACS.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Main current features are:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; - supports only SBCL. Some effort is needed to port<br>
&gt; - tested under Windows and sometimes under Linux<br>
&gt; - every tool is in its own Window - like Lispworks IDE<br>
&gt; - no minibuffer, REPL is used instead to enter complex editor commands not listed in menu (no command completion yet)<br>
&gt; - multi-tabbed text editor with notepad-like look and feel<br>
&gt; - some lisp navigation commands (next/previous sexp, up sexp, mark sexp)<br>
&gt; - support of (in-readtable) form (missing in SLIME)<br>
&gt; - REPL with persistent history and search through the history<br>
&gt; - find in files with mutliple result windows (missing in EMACS)<br>
&gt; - go to definition<br>
&gt; - go to package definition, go to asd system definition (better than in EMACS)<br>
&gt; - inspector<br>
&gt; - debugger (stack, locals, inspect locals, eval in frame, return from frame, invoke restart)<br>
&gt; - thread list (with debug)<br>
&gt; - integration with cl-hyperdoc<br>
&gt; - compilation error browser, errors are sorted by severity (seem to be missing in EMACS)<br>
&gt; - list of definitions in the file (some quick hack with regexp)<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I can say definitely that &quot;clcon&quot; is incomparably more advanced than ABLE and LispIDE. It is weaker than Lispworks on EMACS. I never seen slimv, jabberwocky and so on.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Most of UI and some portions of source code are now in Russian, but if actual collaborator would appear, I can fix that and prepare English version.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I'm spending a very little resource on the development in a last year, but some things are to be done:<br>
&gt; - fix race conditions in the editor (some work is done, but more to do)<br>
&gt; - support CCL<br>
&gt; - improve performance of matching paren highlight<br>
&gt; - find and replace in files<br>
&gt; - automatic window placement<br>
&gt; - multiple editor windows (for now we have &quot;open in another editor&quot; menu item)<br>
&gt; - auto-completion for editor commands<br>
&gt; - improve editor bookmarks (now they are just prototype)<br>
&gt; - IDE programmer's guide (just add more examples indeed)<br>
&gt; - finish inspector GUI (now it misses some essential things)<br>
&gt;<br>

&gt;&gt; One thing I considered but never did (no time as ever) was to convert<br>
&gt;&gt; the swank protocol to Google Buffers format.... has anybody done that<br>
&gt;&gt; already maybe? Then it would open up the protocol to a whole raft of<br>
&gt;&gt; platforms, tools and more importantly, hackers!<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes. I have tried it. I was actually going to look into whether it<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; would be practical to write a C&#43;&#43; client for swank. Although, the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; setup was pretty fiddly. I'm definitely going to use it as a<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Rainer,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have used the LispWorks IDE for a few years now. I was trying to<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; avoid criticizing it here, because I feel like it would be<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; disrespectful on a list dedicated to &quot;LispWorks&quot;. I think the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; LispWorks folks have done a commendable job on their IDE. Having said<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; that, as with all things, you can't please everyone. Unfortunately, I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; find myself unable to get completely comfortable with it. I guess<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; when I'm switching back and forth between different IDEs (Visual<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Studio, QtCreator), LispWorks ends up feeling a little cumbersome. I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; mainly use Linux for Lisp development, so maybe that would matter for<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; my case. I whole heartedly agree with you on the less is more aspect<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; though. I want a lean, smooth, fast environment that gets out of the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; way. I think I would end up writing a lot more lisp code, if I had an<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; IDE like that. I am more than happy to give up some functionality for<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; anything close to the lean, smooth, fast feel. I do feel that all IDE<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; windows and features should be a configuration option. I like IDEs<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; that let me git rid of the stuff that I don't want. I'm definitely<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; not a Java kind of guy and I don't care much for any of that world<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; (even though I've been forced into it a few times). Have you seen<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; QtCreator and other apps written with Qt? What are your thoughts<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; about those apps? I've looked around quite a bit and I haven't been<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; able to come up with a better choice than Qt so far. My current Lisp<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; development environment is Sublime Text and a terminal with a REPL<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; ;-). I've used the LispWorks IDE for debugging a couple of times, but<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't need it very often (even though it is pretty cool).<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks,<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Remember that the LispWorks IDE is already cross platform and comes<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; with an Emacs-like editor. Note also that LispWorks comes with the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; source code for the editor.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; It is also useful to give feedback to the LispWorks developers, since<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; it may help them to see which features would help and integrate it<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; into the product with new versions.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Personally LispWorks is my first choice for writing Lisp code and<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; also some other editing tasks. I have GNU Emacs and also the Aquamacs<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; variant of GNU Emacs.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I like the light-weight editing in LispWorks and the look&amp;feel on the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Mac.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; One can easily add too much visual clutter and too much functionality<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; to an editor. Do we really need code folding? I never use that in GNU<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Emacs. I don't even need paredit or similar. What I use is the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; s-expression based commands in LispWorks and the mouse support, incl.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; mouse copy.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; What I would prefer is slick look &amp; feel. Smooth scrolling, nice<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; fonts, more visual UI for the editor in menus (there are some useful<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; extended commands which are hard to find), quick command overviews, I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; would like to be able to have all information in editor windows<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; clickable (like the external format -&gt; click on it to change it),<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; some improvements in error handling for example when using unicode<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; formats, etc.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I think usability is very important and sometimes less is more. I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; don't need much syntax highlighting and some people were reporting<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; improvements turning it off in their IDEs.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; In the Java-World there are big IDEs like Netbeans, Eclipse and IntelliJ.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; They have much more features than just for Java development. Even<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; though they have lots of useful features which could be reused, I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; would not like to use them for Lisp development.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; It's also that I don't like their visual appearance. They don't look<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; slick and native. They have too many distractions and I don't like<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; the multi-multi-pane window layouts...<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; I too have been where you are. The real *truth* is that there will<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; never be a single perfect LISP IDE because we are all different with<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; different views, preferences etc.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; My cure was a simple series of steps:<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; studying the source code for emacs!!!<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; study the source code for paredit mode carefully!<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; learn to use paredit mode effectively<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; learn to use SLIME effectively<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Unless you have LW (I do but rarely use it even though it is free)<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; and live and breathe in it, Emacs *is* the best ready to go solution IMHO...<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; you just have to really make the mental effort to learn all the short<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; cut keystrokes for all the helpful stuff for manipulating<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; s-expressions, navigation.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; All the best though, I'd certainly be interested BUT what language do we<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; write it in ?&nbsp; &nbsp; ;)<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I ask that because LISP might not be the best cross-platform GUI<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; providing solution... perhaps Clojure would do the job coupled with<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; say J4GL... if you are going to write a good UI ight as well go<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; game-level on it, that was my plan!<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; I hear you and you are right. It is a daunting task. It's just that I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; recently realized that I could continue dreaming or actually start doing<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; something about it. My initial goal would be fairly modest. I would just<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; try to get a syntax highlighting editor going with some kind of project<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; based file management. I'd force myself to use it exclusively, so that I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; would continue to be motivated. I plan to dedicate a certain amount of<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; time<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; each week to the project. I really don't know where it could end up at<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; this point. The remote image thing would be a very high priority though.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Never the less, Rome wasn't built in a day as it were ;-) Thanks for your<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don’t like emacs either. Perhaps you share my dislike of emacs in the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; true sense of the word: GNU Emacs. There have been emacs-like editors<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; that<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; are very good, like xmacs for instance, that would probably be able to do<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; much of what you want.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; The McCLIM guys were at one point trying to create such an editor, you<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; might check over there. You’ll need help, it is a monumental task.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; There’s<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; also the Dylan editor; that might make a good starting point. I’d love to<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; see some investment, time or money, in those editors.<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello All,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I've been contemplating the possibility of writing an IDE for Lisp. I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; know<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; that most Lisp developers use emacs, but try as I might, I have never<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; been<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; able to enjoy using it. I spend a fair amount of time using Visual<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Studio,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; so that could well be a factor. Anyway, I have been wanting a more<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; traditional IDE (in the other language sense) for some time now. I sorely<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; miss certain IDE features when programming in Lisp. Things like a snippet<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; library, code completion, code folding, etc.. One major feature I would<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; like to have is the ability to target multiple remote images. I would<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; probably use Qt and QScintilla as a starting point. I'm posting this<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; because I was wondering if there was anyone else who would be interested<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; in<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; such a thing? If I knew that there was interest, I would probably make<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; different choices when developing the project. I would also be interested<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; in hearing everyone's thoughts on the topic in general. I most certainly<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; don't mean to offend anyone who is using other tools or start some kind<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; of<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; holy war. I'm just trying to find out if there are any like minded<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; individuals out there.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Gerry<br>

&gt; I was thinking about this whole editor thread last night. I am really annoyed with GNU emacs too, and would love to have an non-commercial alternative. The trouble is, I think, the 'lisp curse' more than anything else. We (lispers, collectively), really need
 to focus on community building more than software building.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Climbing down from the soapbox, perhaps contributing / reviving an existing editor project is the best way forward? I had a look again at Dylan Deuce and it seems like a good target. The editor has a good pedigree (in that it was designed and built by some
 ex-Symbolics folks), is a 3rd gen design and it seems DUIM was ported to common-lisp by Duncan Rose.<br>

&gt; Subject: Re: Potential IDE project<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Hi all!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I'm slowly developing my Lisp IDE for about 2 years already. I tried to "advertise" it in 2015, but received nearly zero feedback, so I translated most of its parts to Russian and stopped further advertising.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Key components are:<br>
&gt; 1. SWANK. Hence we have most of tools which present in SLIME (some with lower quality, some are better than in SLIME).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 2. Some lisp-specific editing commands are borrowed from the fork of EMACS-like HEMLOCK editor, so knows something about CL. E.g. there is "indent sexp" command.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 3. Written in a client-server architecture. Server is your lisp image (with IDE server sources loaded), client is a separate GUI application written in tcl/tk. Initially I tried to use tk wrappers for tcl, but quickly rejected that. Writing client in pure
 tcl is much easier and allows to use all tk components. Wrappers suggest rather narrow set of widgets and anyway when problems arise, you have to learn tcl/tk. Also there are some more or less "debuggers" for tcl, which allow to diagnose things with ease.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 4. Permissively licensed.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Site is here <a href="https://bitbucket.org/budden/clcon_en" target="_blank">https://bitbucket.org/budden/clcon_en</a> , but it contains nothing essential today.<br>
&gt; Main branch is here: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/budden/clcon" target="_blank">
https://bitbucket.org/budden/clcon</a><br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Some screenshots are here<br>
&gt; <a href="https://bitbucket.org/budden/clcon/wiki/Screenshots" target="_blank">https://bitbucket.org/budden/clcon/wiki/Screenshots</a> (some old, some in Russian).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Generally, everything is still in deep alpha quality, but I use the environment on a daily basis and almost never use EMACS.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Main current features are:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; - supports only SBCL. Some effort is needed to port<br>
&gt; - tested under Windows and sometimes under Linux<br>
&gt; - every tool is in its own Window - like Lispworks IDE<br>
&gt; - no minibuffer, REPL is used instead to enter complex editor commands not listed in menu (no command completion yet)<br>
&gt; - multi-tabbed text editor with notepad-like look and feel<br>
&gt; - some lisp navigation commands (next/previous sexp, up sexp, mark sexp)<br>
&gt; - support of (in-readtable) form (missing in SLIME)<br>
&gt; - REPL with persistent history and search through the history<br>
&gt; - find in files with mutliple result windows (missing in EMACS)<br>
&gt; - go to definition<br>
&gt; - go to package definition, go to asd system definition (better than in EMACS)<br>
&gt; - inspector<br>
&gt; - debugger (stack, locals, inspect locals, eval in frame, return from frame, invoke restart)<br>
&gt; - thread list (with debug)<br>
&gt; - integration with cl-hyperdoc<br>
&gt; - compilation error browser, errors are sorted by severity (seem to be missing in EMACS)<br>
&gt; - list of definitions in the file (some quick hack with regexp)<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I can say definitely that "clcon" is incomparably more advanced than ABLE and LispIDE. It is weaker than Lispworks on EMACS. I never seen slimv, jabberwocky and so on.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Most of UI and some portions of source code are now in Russian, but if actual collaborator would appear, I can fix that and prepare English version.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I'm spending a very little resource on the development in a last year, but some things are to be done:<br>
&gt; - fix race conditions in the editor (some work is done, but more to do)<br>
&gt; - support CCL<br>
&gt; - improve performance of matching paren highlight<br>
&gt; - find and replace in files<br>
&gt; - automatic window placement<br>
&gt; - multiple editor windows (for now we have "open in another editor" menu item)<br>
&gt; - auto-completion for editor commands<br>
&gt; - improve editor bookmarks (now they are just prototype)<br>
&gt; - IDE programmer's guide (just add more examples indeed)<br>
&gt; - finish inspector GUI (now it misses some essential things)<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>

&gt;&gt; One thing I considered but never did (no time as ever) was to convert<br>
&gt;&gt; the swank protocol to Google Buffers format.... has anybody done that<br>
&gt;&gt; already maybe? Then it would open up the protocol to a whole raft of<br>
&gt;&gt; platforms, tools and more importantly, hackers!<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes. I have tried it. I was actually going to look into whether it<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; would be practical to write a C++ client for swank. Although, the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; setup was pretty fiddly. I'm definitely going to use it as a<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; reference though. One thing I really want is the ability to send the<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; images to remote machines from the IDE.<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Rainer,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have used the LispWorks IDE for a few years now. I was trying to<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; avoid criticizing it here, because I feel like it would be<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; disrespectful on a list dedicated to "LispWorks". I think the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; LispWorks folks have done a commendable job on their IDE. Having said<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; that, as with all things, you can't please everyone. Unfortunately, I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; find myself unable to get completely comfortable with it. I guess<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; when I'm switching back and forth between different IDEs (Visual<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Studio, QtCreator), LispWorks ends up feeling a little cumbersome. I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; mainly use Linux for Lisp development, so maybe that would matter for<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; my case. I whole heartedly agree with you on the less is more aspect<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; though. I want a lean, smooth, fast environment that gets out of the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; way. I think I would end up writing a lot more lisp code, if I had an<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; IDE like that. I am more than happy to give up some functionality for<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; anything close to the lean, smooth, fast feel. I do feel that all IDE<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; windows and features should be a configuration option. I like IDEs<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; that let me git rid of the stuff that I don't want. I'm definitely<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; not a Java kind of guy and I don't care much for any of that world<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; (even though I've been forced into it a few times). Have you seen<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; QtCreator and other apps written with Qt? What are your thoughts<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; about those apps? I've looked around quite a bit and I haven't been<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; able to come up with a better choice than Qt so far. My current Lisp<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; development environment is Sublime Text and a terminal with a REPL<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; ;-). I've used the LispWorks IDE for debugging a couple of times, but<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't need it very often (even though it is pretty cool).<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Gerry<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Remember that the LispWorks IDE is already cross platform and comes<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; with an Emacs-like editor. Note also that LispWorks comes with the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; source code for the editor.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; It is also useful to give feedback to the LispWorks developers, since<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; it may help them to see which features would help and integrate it<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; into the product with new versions.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Personally LispWorks is my first choice for writing Lisp code and<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; also some other editing tasks. I have GNU Emacs and also the Aquamacs<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; variant of GNU Emacs.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I like the light-weight editing in LispWorks and the look&amp;feel on the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Mac.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; One can easily add too much visual clutter and too much functionality<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; to an editor. Do we really need code folding? I never use that in GNU<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Emacs. I don't even need paredit or similar. What I use is the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; s-expression based commands in LispWorks and the mouse support, incl.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; mouse copy.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; What I would prefer is slick look &amp; feel. Smooth scrolling, nice<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; fonts, more visual UI for the editor in menus (there are some useful<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; extended commands which are hard to find), quick command overviews, I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; would like to be able to have all information in editor windows<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; clickable (like the external format -&gt; click on it to change it),<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; some improvements in error handling for example when using unicode<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; formats, etc.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I think usability is very important and sometimes less is more. I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; don't need much syntax highlighting and some people were reporting<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; improvements turning it off in their IDEs.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; In the Java-World there are big IDEs like Netbeans, Eclipse and IntelliJ.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; They have much more features than just for Java development. Even<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; though they have lots of useful features which could be reused, I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; would not like to use them for Lisp development.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; It's also that I don't like their visual appearance. They don't look<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; slick and native. They have too many distractions and I don't like<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; I too have been where you are. The real *truth* is that there will<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; never be a single perfect LISP IDE because we are all different with<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; different views, preferences etc.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; My cure was a simple series of steps:<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; studying the source code for emacs!!!<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; study the source code for paredit mode carefully!<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; learn to use paredit mode effectively<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; learn to use SLIME effectively<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Unless you have LW (I do but rarely use it even though it is free)<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; and live and breathe in it, Emacs *is* the best ready to go solution IMHO...<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; you just have to really make the mental effort to learn all the short<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; cut keystrokes for all the helpful stuff for manipulating<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; s-expressions, navigation.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; All the best though, I'd certainly be interested BUT what language do we<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; write it in ?&nbsp; &nbsp; ;)<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I ask that because LISP might not be the best cross-platform GUI<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; providing solution... perhaps Clojure would do the job coupled with<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; say J4GL... if you are going to write a good UI ight as well go<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; game-level on it, that was my plan!<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; :)<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; All the best!!!<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Steven,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I hear you and you are right. It is a daunting task. It's just that I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; recently realized that I could continue dreaming or actually start doing<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; something about it. My initial goal would be fairly modest. I would just<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; try to get a syntax highlighting editor going with some kind of project<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; based file management. I'd force myself to use it exclusively, so that I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; would continue to be motivated. I plan to dedicate a certain amount of<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; time<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; each week to the project. I really don't know where it could end up at<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; this point. The remote image thing would be a very high priority though.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Never the less, Rome wasn't built in a day as it were ;-) Thanks for your<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; response.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don’t like emacs either. Perhaps you share my dislike of emacs in the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; true sense of the word: GNU Emacs. There have been emacs-like editors<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; that<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; are very good, like xmacs for instance, that would probably be able to do<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; much of what you want.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; The McCLIM guys were at one point trying to create such an editor, you<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; might check over there. You’ll need help, it is a monumental task.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; There’s<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; also the Dylan editor; that might make a good starting point. I’d love to<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; see some investment, time or money, in those editors.<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello All,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I've been contemplating the possibility of writing an IDE for Lisp. I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; know<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; that most Lisp developers use emacs, but try as I might, I have never<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; been<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; able to enjoy using it. I spend a fair amount of time using Visual<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Studio,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; so that could well be a factor. Anyway, I have been wanting a more<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; traditional IDE (in the other language sense) for some time now.. I sorely<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; miss certain IDE features when programming in Lisp. Things like a snippet<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; library, code completion, code folding, etc.. One major feature I would<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; like to have is the ability to target multiple remote images. I would<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; probably use Qt and QScintilla as a starting point. I'm posting this<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; because I was wondering if there was anyone else who would be interested<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; in<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; such a thing? If I knew that there was interest, I would probably make<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; different choices when developing the project. I would also be interested<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; in hearing everyone's thoughts on the topic in general. I most certainly<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; don't mean to offend anyone who is using other tools or start some kind<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; of<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; holy war. I'm just trying to find out if there are any like minded<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; individuals out there.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Gerry<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>

&gt; Subject: Re: Potential IDE project<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Hi all!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I'm slowly developing my Lisp IDE for about 2 years already. I tried to &quot;advertise&quot; it in 2015, but received nearly zero feedback, so I translated most of its parts to Russian and stopped further advertising.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Key components are:<br>
&gt; 1. SWANK. Hence we have most of tools which present in SLIME (some with lower quality, some are better than in SLIME).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 2. Some lisp-specific editing commands are borrowed from the fork of EMACS-like HEMLOCK editor, so knows something about CL. E.g. there is &quot;indent sexp&quot; command.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 3. Written in a client-server architecture. Server is your lisp image (with IDE server sources loaded), client is a separate GUI application written in tcl/tk. Initially I tried to use tk wrappers for tcl, but quickly rejected that. Writing client in pure
 tcl is much easier and allows to use all tk components. Wrappers suggest rather narrow set of widgets and anyway when problems arise, you have to learn tcl/tk. Also there are some more or less &quot;debuggers&quot; for tcl, which allow to diagnose things with ease.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 4. Permissively licensed.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Site is here <a href="https://bitbucket.org/budden/clcon_en" target="_blank">https://bitbucket.org/budden/clcon_en</a> , but it contains nothing essential today.<br>
&gt; Main branch is here: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/budden/clcon" target="_blank">
https://bitbucket.org/budden/clcon</a><br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Some screenshots are here<br>
&gt; <a href="https://bitbucket.org/budden/clcon/wiki/Screenshots" target="_blank">https://bitbucket.org/budden/clcon/wiki/Screenshots</a> (some old, some in Russian).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Generally, everything is still in deep alpha quality, but I use the environment on a daily basis and almost never use EMACS.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Main current features are:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; - supports only SBCL. Some effort is needed to port<br>
&gt; - tested under Windows and sometimes under Linux<br>
&gt; - every tool is in its own Window - like Lispworks IDE<br>
&gt; - no minibuffer, REPL is used instead to enter complex editor commands not listed in menu (no command completion yet)<br>
&gt; - multi-tabbed text editor with notepad-like look and feel<br>
&gt; - some lisp navigation commands (next/previous sexp, up sexp, mark sexp)<br>
&gt; - support of (in-readtable) form (missing in SLIME)<br>
&gt; - REPL with persistent history and search through the history<br>
&gt; - find in files with mutliple result windows (missing in EMACS)<br>
&gt; - go to definition<br>
&gt; - go to package definition, go to asd system definition (better than in EMACS)<br>
&gt; - inspector<br>
&gt; - debugger (stack, locals, inspect locals, eval in frame, return from frame, invoke restart)<br>
&gt; - thread list (with debug)<br>
&gt; - integration with cl-hyperdoc<br>
&gt; - compilation error browser, errors are sorted by severity (seem to be missing in EMACS)<br>
&gt; - list of definitions in the file (some quick hack with regexp)<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I can say definitely that &quot;clcon&quot; is incomparably more advanced than ABLE and LispIDE. It is weaker than Lispworks on EMACS. I never seen slimv, jabberwocky and so on.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Most of UI and some portions of source code are now in Russian, but if actual collaborator would appear, I can fix that and prepare English version.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I'm spending a very little resource on the development in a last year, but some things are to be done:<br>
&gt; - fix race conditions in the editor (some work is done, but more to do)<br>
&gt; - support CCL<br>
&gt; - improve performance of matching paren highlight<br>
&gt; - find and replace in files<br>
&gt; - automatic window placement<br>
&gt; - multiple editor windows (for now we have &quot;open in another editor&quot; menu item)<br>
&gt; - auto-completion for editor commands<br>
&gt; - improve editor bookmarks (now they are just prototype)<br>
&gt; - IDE programmer's guide (just add more examples indeed)<br>
&gt; - finish inspector GUI (now it misses some essential things)<br>
&gt;<br>

&gt;&gt; One thing I considered but never did (no time as ever) was to convert<br>
&gt;&gt; the swank protocol to Google Buffers format.... has anybody done that<br>
&gt;&gt; already maybe? Then it would open up the protocol to a whole raft of<br>
&gt;&gt; platforms, tools and more importantly, hackers!<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes. I have tried it. I was actually going to look into whether it<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; would be practical to write a C&#43;&#43; client for swank. Although, the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; setup was pretty fiddly. I'm definitely going to use it as a<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; reference though. One thing I really want is the ability to send the<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Rainer,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I have used the LispWorks IDE for a few years now. I was trying to<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; avoid criticizing it here, because I feel like it would be<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; disrespectful on a list dedicated to &quot;LispWorks&quot;. I think the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; LispWorks folks have done a commendable job on their IDE. Having said<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; that, as with all things, you can't please everyone. Unfortunately, I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; find myself unable to get completely comfortable with it. I guess<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; when I'm switching back and forth between different IDEs (Visual<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Studio, QtCreator), LispWorks ends up feeling a little cumbersome. I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; mainly use Linux for Lisp development, so maybe that would matter for<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; my case. I whole heartedly agree with you on the less is more aspect<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; though. I want a lean, smooth, fast environment that gets out of the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; way. I think I would end up writing a lot more lisp code, if I had an<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; IDE like that. I am more than happy to give up some functionality for<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; anything close to the lean, smooth, fast feel. I do feel that all IDE<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; windows and features should be a configuration option. I like IDEs<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; that let me git rid of the stuff that I don't want. I'm definitely<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; not a Java kind of guy and I don't care much for any of that world<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; (even though I've been forced into it a few times). Have you seen<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; QtCreator and other apps written with Qt? What are your thoughts<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; about those apps? I've looked around quite a bit and I haven't been<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; able to come up with a better choice than Qt so far. My current Lisp<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; development environment is Sublime Text and a terminal with a REPL<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; ;-). I've used the LispWorks IDE for debugging a couple of times, but<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't need it very often (even though it is pretty cool).<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks,<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Remember that the LispWorks IDE is already cross platform and comes<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; with an Emacs-like editor. Note also that LispWorks comes with the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; source code for the editor.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; It is also useful to give feedback to the LispWorks developers, since<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; it may help them to see which features would help and integrate it<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; into the product with new versions.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Personally LispWorks is my first choice for writing Lisp code and<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; also some other editing tasks. I have GNU Emacs and also the Aquamacs<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; variant of GNU Emacs.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I like the light-weight editing in LispWorks and the look&amp;feel on the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Mac.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; One can easily add too much visual clutter and too much functionality<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; to an editor. Do we really need code folding? I never use that in GNU<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Emacs. I don't even need paredit or similar. What I use is the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; s-expression based commands in LispWorks and the mouse support, incl.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; mouse copy.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; What I would prefer is slick look &amp; feel. Smooth scrolling, nice<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; fonts, more visual UI for the editor in menus (there are some useful<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; extended commands which are hard to find), quick command overviews, I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; would like to be able to have all information in editor windows<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; clickable (like the external format -&gt; click on it to change it),<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; some improvements in error handling for example when using unicode<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; formats, etc.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I think usability is very important and sometimes less is more. I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; don't need much syntax highlighting and some people were reporting<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; improvements turning it off in their IDEs.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; In the Java-World there are big IDEs like Netbeans, Eclipse and IntelliJ.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; They have much more features than just for Java development. Even<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; though they have lots of useful features which could be reused, I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; would not like to use them for Lisp development.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; It's also that I don't like their visual appearance. They don't look<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; slick and native. They have too many distractions and I don't like<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; the multi-multi-pane window layouts...<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; I too have been where you are. The real *truth* is that there will<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; never be a single perfect LISP IDE because we are all different with<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; different views, preferences etc.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; My cure was a simple series of steps:<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; studying the source code for emacs!!!<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; study the source code for paredit mode carefully!<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; learn to use paredit mode effectively<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; learn to use SLIME effectively<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Unless you have LW (I do but rarely use it even though it is free)<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; and live and breathe in it, Emacs *is* the best ready to go solution IMHO...<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; you just have to really make the mental effort to learn all the short<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; cut keystrokes for all the helpful stuff for manipulating<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; s-expressions, navigation.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; All the best though, I'd certainly be interested BUT what language do we<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; write it in ?&nbsp; &nbsp; ;)<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I ask that because LISP might not be the best cross-platform GUI<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; providing solution... perhaps Clojure would do the job coupled with<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; say J4GL... if you are going to write a good UI ight as well go<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; game-level on it, that was my plan!<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; I hear you and you are right. It is a daunting task. It's just that I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; recently realized that I could continue dreaming or actually start doing<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; something about it. My initial goal would be fairly modest. I would just<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; try to get a syntax highlighting editor going with some kind of project<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; based file management. I'd force myself to use it exclusively, so that I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; would continue to be motivated. I plan to dedicate a certain amount of<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; time<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; each week to the project. I really don't know where it could end up at<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; this point. The remote image thing would be a very high priority though.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Never the less, Rome wasn't built in a day as it were ;-) Thanks for your<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; response.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Gerry<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don’t like emacs either. Perhaps you share my dislike of emacs in the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; true sense of the word: GNU Emacs. There have been emacs-like editors<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; that<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; are very good, like xmacs for instance, that would probably be able to do<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; much of what you want.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; The McCLIM guys were at one point trying to create such an editor, you<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; might check over there. You’ll need help, it is a monumental task.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; There’s<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; also the Dylan editor; that might make a good starting point. I’d love to<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; see some investment, time or money, in those editors.<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello All,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I've been contemplating the possibility of writing an IDE for Lisp. I<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; know<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; that most Lisp developers use emacs, but try as I might, I have never<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; been<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; able to enjoy using it. I spend a fair amount of time using Visual<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Studio,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; so that could well be a factor. Anyway, I have been wanting a more<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; traditional IDE (in the other language sense) for some time now. I sorely<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; miss certain IDE features when programming in Lisp. Things like a snippet<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; library, code completion, code folding, etc.. One major feature I would<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; like to have is the ability to target multiple remote images. I would<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; probably use Qt and QScintilla as a starting point. I'm posting this<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; because I was wondering if there was anyone else who would be interested<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; in<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; such a thing? If I knew that there was interest, I would probably make<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; different choices when developing the project. I would also be interested<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; in hearing everyone's thoughts on the topic in general. I most certainly<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; don't mean to offend anyone who is using other tools or start some kind<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; of<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; holy war. I'm just trying to find out if there are any like minded<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; individuals out there.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Gerry<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>

                 <h1>Re: Potential IDE project</h1>
                 <pre>Hi All,

I have been watching this thread while on travel in Europe, and now finally back home in my own lab.

I have used things like Visual Studio, Xcode, Eclipse, and the Dylan system on Mac, as well as being a nearly 40 year veteran of Emacs. I’m trying to understand what your desires are in an editor for Lisp. All of the aforementioned IDE’s were aimed at strongly OOPL approaches, where displaying Classes and their Hierarchies makes a lot of sense.

But Lisp is only that kind of OOPL on some occasions, not anywhere near 100%, in my experience. So I’m wondering what it is that you really want in a Lisp environment that Emacs or Lispworks don’t already provide? Is it a more consistent key bindings methodology? Or are you more interested in a cross-language display paradigm that supports more admixtures of Web programming languages like JS and XML, in addition to Lisp?

                 <pre>… okay, I see that I totally misinterpreted what this thread was about. An embedded editor solution was needed. I had thought that people were thinking about what the next leap in Lisp editing would be all about. I guess Lisp is still a few decades beyond the conventional languages. Just not as pretty.

I personally find that current day apps, with layers upon layers of drop-down menus, and artificial categorizations of commands among multiple menus, very unpleasant to use. You have to try to remember which menu you last saw that command. And pretty looking buttons often offer very scan hints on what function they perform. I do not see that as progress against the 1980’s style of text-based settings and personality files.

But I do try to imagine what the editor for the next generation would look like. How many different ways one might want to view the source code for a project. Long linear text at one extreme, and Smalltalk snippet displays at another extreme. The long linear text often shows too much detail and you get lost in it. The Smalltalk panels often offer too little context with respect to their associated Methods. Folded editing is one approach to cutting down on excess information. But what would the next gen editor show?

If a window system of a platform is not capable enough that now each applications implement their own sort-of window systems, then there is something wrong with the platform. I personally also like to have less tools on the screen visible, then even more. Sometimes when I use a JAVA IDE, there is barely enough space to actually edit code - especially on laptops.

I totally agree with you on the nested menu thing. I want all of that to be configurable, so that I can choose what is visible. There is a feature I've used that allows you to create different workspaces (ie; windows position, tool bars, menus, etc.). You can then switch between them with a key sequence or tool button click. You can setup workspaces that are tailored for certain tasks. I find that pretty compelling.<br class=""><br class="">8. I find context sensitive help and documentation lookup useful (Qt Creator is a good example of this). <br class=""></div></div></blockquote><div><br class=""></div>There is some in the Lispworks IDE.

 environment. There are things that LispWorks is good at that really wouldn’t/shouldn’t need to be replicated. I just find that I normally don’t need a lot of them and that I’m willing to trade some things for a different look and feel. I agree that LispWorks
 has some very nice debugging facilities and that trying to duplicate those would really be a waste of time. I think it would be easy to take my remarks as a critique of the LispWorks GUI, but that is not my intention at all. I think of my little project as
 augmenting the existing tools for my needs. If I were trying to debug a difficult problem, I would most certainly reach for the LispWorks debugger. However, like many other features, I don’t use it all that often. I want to be able to use the LispWorks tools
 when I need them, but I don’t want to live there all of the time. I want a tool that is lighter and snappier that lives outside the image. In other words, I feel like my project will sit alongside LispWorks in my toolbox, not replace it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi David,<br>
<br>
I have enjoyed reading everyone's take on the editor they would like to have. Some very interesting things have come to light. While I can't speak for anyone else, I can try to tell you what motivated my post. I switch between Visual Studio, Qt Creator, and
 Sublime Text. I would like something a little more like them for Lisp. <br>
<br>
1. For me it is about more than an editor. I'm wanting a IDE that provides some additional features. The ability to target and deploy multiple images would be a good example.<o:p></o:p></p>

7. I totally agree with you on the nested menu thing. I want all of that to be configurable, so that I can choose what is visible. There is a feature I've used that allows you to create different workspaces (ie; windows position, tool bars, menus, etc.). You
 can then switch between them with a key sequence or tool button click. You can setup workspaces that are tailored for certain tasks. I find that pretty compelling.<br>
<br>
8. I find context sensitive help and documentation lookup useful (Qt Creator is a good example of this).

Subject: Re: Potential IDE project<br>
<br>
… okay, I see that I totally misinterpreted what this thread was about. An embedded editor solution was needed. I had thought that people were thinking about what the next leap in Lisp editing would be all about. I guess Lisp is still a few decades beyond the
 conventional languages. Just not as pretty.<br>
<br>
I personally find that current day apps, with layers upon layers of drop-down menus, and artificial categorizations of commands among multiple menus, very unpleasant to use. You have to try to remember which menu you last saw that command. And pretty looking
 buttons often offer very scan hints on what function they perform. I do not see that as progress against the 1980’s style of text-based settings and personality files.<br>
<br>
But I do try to imagine what the editor for the next generation would look like. How many different ways one might want to view the source code for a project. Long linear text at one extreme, and Smalltalk snippet displays at another extreme. The long linear
 text often shows too much detail and you get lost in it. The Smalltalk panels often offer too little context with respect to their associated Methods. Folded editing is one approach to cutting down on excess information. But what would the next gen editor
 show?<br>

There are things that LispWorks is good at that really wouldn’t/shouldn’t need to be replicated. I just find that I normally don’t need a lot of them and that I’m willing to trade some things for a different look and feel. I agree that LispWorks has some very nice debugging facilities and that trying to duplicate those would really be a waste of time. I think it would be easy to take my remarks as a critique of the LispWorks GUI, but that is not my intention at all. I think of my little project as augmenting the existing tools for my needs. If I were trying to debug a difficult problem, I would most certainly reach for the LispWorks debugger. However, like many other features, I don’t use it all that often. I want to be able to use the LispWorks tools when I need them, but I don’t want to live there all of the time. I want a tool that is lighter and snappier that lives outside the image.

 environment. There are things that LispWorks is good at that really wouldn’t/shouldn’t need to be replicated. I just find that I normally don’t need a lot of them and that I’m willing to trade some things for a different look and feel. I agree that LispWorks
 has some very nice debugging facilities and that trying to duplicate those would really be a waste of time. I think it would be easy to take my remarks as a critique of the LispWorks GUI, but that is not my intention at all. I think of my little project as
 augmenting the existing tools for my needs. If I were trying to debug a difficult problem, I would most certainly reach for the LispWorks debugger. However, like many other features, I don’t use it all that often. I want to be able to use the LispWorks tools
 when I need them, but I don’t want to live there all of the time. I want a tool that is lighter and snappier that lives outside the image. In other words, I feel like my project will sit alongside LispWorks in my toolbox, not replace it.</span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;color:#1F497D">Point taken. However, one of the unfortunate realities of Lisp in general is the lack and breadth of libraries. While I’m sure it is possible to create a reasonable
 GUI in Lisp, I’m not sure how practical it really is in this case. I would end up reinventing a lot of stuff that comes out of the box with Qt. Qt can also look really good when used effectively. When considering a project, I always look at library availability
 very closely. &nbsp;While Lisp is a very productive language in general, the need to reinvent stuff can offset that pretty quickly. If time wasn’t a factor, I would always go for tier 1. Being that I only write Lisp on Unix, I was really considering Qt for a quick
 start and the benefit of others. I’m afraid I’m not fully aware of the Qt on Mac issues even though I am aware that there are some. However, I don’t know how many of them are Qt itself versus implementation choices. Having said all of this, I’m sure my very
 limited experience with capi would be a major limiting factor as well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">With LispWorks we then are in tier-2: cross platform &#43; native. LispWorks interfaces directly to the native platform (and not through something like Qt), provides its own cross platform framework and reuses lots of native UI elements (menus,
 windows, various prompters, drawing, ...) - which makes it comparable/competitive to something like Qt. But even Qt is not very pretty on my Mac. Qt is enough to deliver GUI apps on a Mac, but some applications tend to look&amp;feel unsexy in many ways.<o:p></o:p></p>

Mozilla's XUL tried to provide a higher-level language for GUI elements
(in, ugh, XML and RDF :-(), but never got much traction, AFAICT.

It has always seemed to me that the web breakdown into HTML &amp; CSS has
been a disaster, because web applications have evolved and the HTML +
CSS world view theoretically provides "content" and "presentation", but
nowhere "behavior," and the nice way of declaratively attaching
presentation to content is not paralleled by any way to declaratively
attach behavior to content.

It’s good to see active discussions in this mailing list; but I think it’s humiliating that this whole “IDE" thread happens in the mailing list of LispWorks, which offers the best “available" IDE for Common Lisp.

The only thing I've learnt here, is the existence of the projectured [1] (from Camille), and I may try it in the future. Nothing else.

                 <pre>Hi Chun,

I feel very differently about this. I am a LispWorks user/customer. While I agree that LispWorks provides the best IDE available, there is still room for improvement. Hopefully, the LispWorks devs will consider some of the comments made here for future enhancements. One thing I am extremely grateful for is the fact that a polite and objective discussion like this can occur on this list. It speaks highly of LispWorks and the LispWorks community. I posted to this list, because of that and the fact that I respect the opinions here. I'm sorry, if you found it annoying in some way.

Thanks,
Gerry

                 <pre>Hi Denis,

I wasn't ignoring your post. I wanted to wait until I had the time to look at the links you provided and think it over. Since you ask, I would say c/tk would be tier 2 and tcl/tk would be tier 3. Please don't mind this tier business too much. It is just my own brand of nonsense. I kind of regret mentioning it. I believe people should use the languages and tools that suite them best.

I do appreciate the reminder about tk though. I had been meaning to take another look at that from a c perspective. I remember it being very light weight and snappy. I'm just not sure how much work would be required to get it to a level I would be satisfied with. Having said that, I do think it is possible to create a tk GUI that looks good. Your project is interesting. I plan to download it and take it for a spin when I have the time. I think I would have a tendency to flip it around and use c for the gui and tcl as an embedded scripting language though. What is it that you like about tcl? I'm just curious.

Someone also emailed me privately about wxWidgets. I will be taking a look at that as well. License and static linking is a bonus there. It is also a lot lighter weight than Qt, if I remember correctly. It has been quite a few years since I last used it.

Thanks,
Gerry

Hi Gerry!

I have my CL IDE written in tcl/tk (you didn't react on my message about it on Lisp HUG).

What do you think about tk? Is it 2-d tier or 3-d tier in your view? I know it has a bad reputation, but, frankly, I never found it "ugly".
Maybe something is wrong with my eyes. There are some issues in tk, but they are not on "pretty-ugly" axis.

This can be relevant:

&gt Hi Rainer,
&gt
&gt Yes. I would imagine there could be some confusion about my motives. I 
&gt thought I had mentioned something before, but I’ve deleted the emails. 
&gt Let me go on record as saying that I’m a very satisfied LispWorks user 
&gt and customer. When I decided to get into Lisp, I found LispWorks to be 
&gt the clear choice far and away from the other options out there. I’m 
&gt very happy about the inclusion of 64bit in the professional version 
&gt and I will be purchasing licenses for Linux and FreeBSD when the next release comes out.
&gt
&gt Now that I think of it, my issue with the GUI is really not a 
&gt LispWorks issue per se. I think it has more to do with my view of GUIs 
&gt in general. I look at there being 3 tiers of GUI. There is native 
&gt (.net, cocoa, gtk), native/cross platform (Qt, WxWidgets), and other 
&gt (Lisp, Java, etc.). I have never cared much for anything in the 3rd 
&gt tier. I guess it boils down to who it is for. If the customer/end 
&gt user/me is the priority, then to me, tier 3 is not an option. I think 
&gt what I really want is a Lisp IDE that is in tier 2 at most. Then 
&gt again, I’m pretty pragmatic about my use of tools and languages. The 
&gt right tool for the job and all ;-)
&gt
&gt
&gt
&gt Thanks,
&gt Gerry

&gt&gt but I quickly realized that I failed to explain that I’m not 
&gt&gt interested in creating replacement for the LispWorks environment.
&gt
&gt Sure, but this is the LispWorks mailing list, so don't be surprised if 
&gt people think about that in relationship to the Lispworks IDE. ;-)
&gt
&gt&gt I want a tool that is lighter
&gt
&gt Again, that's an interesting point from the viewpoint of a Lispworks user.
&gt ;-)  When a tool gets updated for 30 years it might assemble a lot of 
&gt functionality, functionality which is may be no longer discoverable 
&gt and/or rarely used. Some UI elements - and I'm including the 
&gt text/command based UI
&gt - might need refactoring. Sometimes it's not the amount of new 
&gt features, but the rearrangement and cleaning up of the UI which brings progress, too.
&gt
&gt Unfortunately ;-) I don't think all of the current UI trends in IDEs 
&gt are real improvements. Many developers are not very good in UI/UX 
&gt topics and develop their own theories. From a developer view though, 
&gt actually some stuff is progress. For example I like the integration of 
&gt test tools (start tests, view results, inspect failed tests, ...) into 
&gt an IDE. Lispworks has the compilation conditions browser, but not a UI for tests.

I believe that Franz uses Gtk for their UI stuff....  But I'm not sure
it's actually portable across platforms (maybe Windows has a different
one?).

<p>I've been contemplating the possibility of writing an IDE for Lisp. I know that most Lisp developers use emacs, but try as I might, I have never been able to enjoy using it. I spend a fair amount of time using Visual Studio, so that could well be a factor.
 Anyway, I have been wanting a more traditional IDE (in the other language sense) for some time now. I sorely miss certain IDE features when programming in Lisp. Things like a snippet library, code completion, code folding, etc.. One major feature I would like
 to have is the ability to target multiple remote images. I would probably use Qt and QScintilla as a starting point. I'm posting this because I was wondering if there was anyone else who would be interested in such a thing? If I knew that there was interest,
 I would probably make different choices when developing the project. I would also be interested in hearing everyone's thoughts on the topic in general. I most certainly don't mean to offend anyone who is using other tools or start some kind of holy war. I'm
 just trying to find out if there are any like minded individuals out there..<br>

 not sure what to make of the latter. I guess I don&#8217;t understand what is at stake and how my project represents such a threat to those individuals. I was also surprised that some folks provided positive feedback privately, but did not want to have it known
 publicly. So&#8230; Based on the relatively low interest level in what I&#8217;m trying to do, I will continue my efforts quietly. I may put something out there at some point, but it is not a priority. I have managed to get something basic going that is already a big
 improvement over how I was working before. For those of you that are interested in what I&#8217;m doing, I will be glad to correspond with you privately going forward. However, as far as I&#8217;m concerned at least, this thread has probably run its course.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 some Lisp/LispWorks questions as I try to get things like debugging working and I hope that I will be able to get some help on those in the future. To all of those who sent the private emails, which could be characterized as nothing less than rabid insanity,
 relax. Take a deep breath. Your safe. For now ;-) &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
