                <h1>Keep TAB for focus in output-pane</h1>
                <pre>Hi,

In an output-pane, if I assign (:key :press) to the input-model, the TAB key can no longer be used for changing focus in the interface. Sometimes, this is just what you want, a possibility to capture the TAB key and do whatever you want. But sometimes, it would be nice to keep its default effect of giving focus to the next element.

Of course, I could implement a handler for the TAB key, and set focus myself using (capi:set-pane-focus). But as far as I can tell, there is no way of getting the next element in the focus chain using the CAPI (correct me if Iâ€™m wrong!), so I would have to hard-code a reference to the next element, which is not very nice. Is there no better way?!

A more general solution (take it as a feature request for future versions of LispWorks!) would be the possibility to choose if a keyboard event should be further processed or not, preferably using the return value for the key handler. That is the way it works in e.g. javascript.

Regards
Erik

                 <pre>Hi Erik,

A small contribution to your suggestion...

What about this? If handlers were CLOS objects, we could use CALL-NEXT-METHOD to further process events. And it would allow for a backward compatible API change (since its easy to make the difference between a function and a CLOS object).
