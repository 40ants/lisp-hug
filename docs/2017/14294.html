                <h1>LispWorks multiplication-table.list example: No errors, Where is the file it 
                 is writing?</h1>
                <pre>I am trying to insert my code into the LispWorks example. My code is
supposed to write to a log file, "log.txt".

I tried my code in the listener. I get the file "log.txt" where I
expect it. However, when I run the example, I don't find any file. I
don't get any errors.

My code is:

========== start of code ==========

;;; This is the "computation" that this server is doing. 
(defun format-multiplication-table-line (stream line integer)
     (print-at-server-too 
         stream

         ;; The following is the original line of the example file:
         ;; (format stream "~D x ~D = ~D" line integer (* line integer))  )
)

         ;; I modified to return a string which is passed to function
print-at-server-too
         (format nil  "~D x ~D = ~D~%" line integer (* line integer))  )  )



(defun print-at-server-too (stream str-to-print)
     ;; The following line does what used to be done
     ;; in the calling function
     (format stream str-to-print)

     ;; This calls my function to write the same thing to
     ;; a file on the server
     (print-at-server-too-1 str-to-print)

     ;; This returns the same string passed into this function
     str-to-print)




(defun print-at-server-too-1 (a-str)

  ;;; This is supposed to open a file, append the string
  ;;; then close the file. Don't get any errors. But cannot
  ;;; find the file written. Where is it? Not in (get-working-directory).
  ;;; Is it written anywhere?
  (with-open-file (out-log "log.txt" :direction :output
            :if-exists :append :if-does-not-exist :create)

         (write-line a-str out-log))  )

========== end of code ==========

I don't know whether this will work because I am new, but I will attach the
2 
example files, "multiplication-table.lisp" (which I modified) and
"driver.lisp".

Maybe there is something about multiple threads, which I think this example
uses. But I don't think there should be. I would think all threads should be
able to write to a file, just not at the same time to the same file.

I also appreciate any tips in how to use this forum. Since Gmane is not 
working, I never was able to see anything that was posted before. And I
don't know whether this is how it is supposed to be or not.

My question is: Is "log.txt" getting written anywhere?

                 <pre>Why not give a full pathname, instead of just ”log.txt”? That way you could control yourself where the file ends up!

“log.txt” is not a complete pathname. It only specifies the name and the type components of a pathname.
In portable Common Lisp the missing components (directory, …) are coming from the value of *DEFAULT-PATHNAME-DEFAULTS* .

If there is not a more specific pathname in there, then it might lead to your file ending up in the root directory - on Unix-like machines.
