                <h1>Release of LispWorks 7.1</h1>
                <pre>LispWorks Ltd is pleased to announce the release of LispWorks 7.1 on
Windows®, Macintosh®, x86/x86_64 Linux®, ARM Linux®, ARM64 Linux®,
FreeBSD®, AIX®, x86/x64 Solaris(TM) and SPARC/Solaris(TM) platforms,
Android and iOS platforms.

LispWorks 7.1 brings these new features:

* Support for 64-bit iOS.
* Support for ARM64 linux (aarch64).
* CAPI stacked tree pane (similar to Flame Graphs).
* Improved profiler tool in the IDE.
* IDE debugging of a remote LispWorks image including on Android and iOS.
* Configuring the appearance of tools in the IDE.
* Tracing of subfunctions (flet etc).
* Multiprocessing enhancements for mailboxes.
* Support for SIMD vector types in the FLI.
* Common SQL support for SQLite.
* Profiling of KnowledgeWorks rules.
* Various other new features including:
  - Support for OpenSSL 1.1.
  - Asynchronous SSL socket I/O.
  - Support for define-declaration for user-defined declaration handlers.
* Bug fixes.


Not all features are supported for every LispWorks product and
platform. For details please see the feature table at

  http://www.lispworks.com/products/features.html

LispWorks Professional and Enterprise Editions still offer excellent
value to commercial users and academic institutions with no runtime
license fees.  An annual maintenance contract is available.

LispWorks Hobbyist and HobbyistDV Editions offer an affordable fully
functional Common Lisp IDE for non-commercial and non-academic use by
individuals.

LispWorks for Android Runtime allows you to deliver (non-GUI) Lisp
libraries which you can incorporate into Android apps ("mobile Lisp
libraries"). It is available as an add-on to customers with LispWorks
7.1, which you use to develop your code before creating the mobile
Lisp library. We do not charge runtime license fees for mobile Lisp
libraries generated by LispWorks for Android Runtime.

LispWorks for iOS Runtime allows you to deliver (non-GUI) Lisp
libraries which you can incorporate into iOS apps. It is available as
an add-on to customers with LispWorks 7.1, which you use to develop
your code before creating the mobile Lisp library. We do not charge
runtime license fees for mobile Lisp libraries generated by LispWorks
for iOS Runtime.

                 <h1>Re: Release of LispWorks 7.1</h1>
                 <pre>I've just spent a few hours getting 7.1 set up.  Apart from it being just a joy to do things in Lisp again after the death-in-life that is Python, and the LW environment being as pleasant as it always has been, it is just really nice to come back to a system where installing a new release doesn't consist of discovering what subset of things-I-rely-on-working has been broken or deprecated this time and spending several days trying to work around this week's braindamage and eventually just abandoning half of the things that used to work.  I have mildly-LW-specific code I think I last changed in 2004 on an entirely different platform than I now use which *just works* when I recompile it.

LispWorks is just great: it reminds me that programming can be an enjoyable activity.
