                 <pre>I don't think Lispworks can be embedded like that. Many CL
implementations expect to be in control of their own process space.
You could communicate with Lispworks in a sibling process, whether
over a socket or other IPC mechanism. There are also CL
implementations which are designed to be embedded, like ECL.
