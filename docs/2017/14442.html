                <h1>Looking for volunteer to test ASDF on Lispworks Windows?</h1>
                <pre>We are about to make a new ASDF release, but would like to test it on LW
Windows before we do.

Unfortunately, my Windows VM is irretrievably lost (sigh: VMware puts
its VMware in the -- to me un-backed-up -- /var directory).

So, is there anyone out there with Lispworks for Windows and cygwin who
would be willing to run the test suite?  If so, please LMK, and I would
be happy to explain how to grab the sources and run the test suite.

thanks,
r

I should have been more clear in my original post, sorry.

This would have to be someone with a paid copy of LW.

The test scripts rely on being able to run LW from the command line,
instead of interactively, because they are based on make and bash.

Since LW can only be run from the command-line if you make an image that
permits it, and you can only make an image if you have the paid version
of LW, you can only test ASDF if you have a paid version of LW.

Sorry about the confusion.
