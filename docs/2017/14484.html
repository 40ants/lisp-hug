                <pre>When CLIM first came out I was a big fan, but unfortunately rapidly realized that if one weren’t trying to build applications that looked and acted like the typical LispM application it became extremely hard to use (e.g. if one wanted to track mouse velocity)… not the sort of thing one wanted for UI research…

I think we need some better mechanism for associating gesture &amp; context to speech act for input and speech act to semiotic or, better, experience on output. (Here I use speech act for any illocutionary act, not just speech). GUI is itself a cul-de-sac that limits expression.

The work done on the CMU Garnet project is some of the most exciting in
this way.  There's some oddities in it, like it uses its own object
system (I think it was started before CLOS was fully matured), but
overall it's a really great rethink of the whole GUI idea.

Of course, it's so old that it doesn't have the broader UI idea of
speech, drawing, writing, etc., but still....

The use of prototype-based objects is hard to wrap your head around, but
the formula-based UI construction is brilliant.
