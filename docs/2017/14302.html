                <h1>Wow... network connection timings?</h1>
                <pre>Hi all,

I’m running on OS X Sierra tonight. And making a local connection to myself at 127.0.0.1 is taking about 11 sec at the initial opening. Thereafter, around 25 ms through negotiated layers of encryption. Anybody else see these whopping long connection startup times? 

The connection to a PC Windows machine on the local area network is taking 30 sec for initial connection. What is going on? I don’t think it is LW to blame for this…

                 <pre>Hi David,

Did you try establish the connection with WiFi and Ethernet disconnected?
It could help troubleshooting router / DNS issues.


Best,
Cam

This is usually fouled-up DNS.  A good test (as someone else said) is to nuke any external connectivity and  try connecting then.  Also try 'dig -x 127.0.0.1' for instance to see how long it takes and whether you get something like SERVFAIL back.

                 <pre>Hi,

Welcome!

I would recommend to install Quicklisp to get an access to tons of
opensource projects: https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/

As soon as you install Quicklisp, you can install the package you
interested in using quicklisp, for example to install Alexandria:

(ql:quickload :alexandria)

Then you can navigate the system with System Browser: menu
Window-&gtTools-&gtSystem Browser (on Mac at least). Type asdf:alexandria
there. You can select file/package there.

To jump to the definition use menu option Expression-&gtFind Source.

I would recommend to read IDE User Guide to understand how to use LW
better, find it here for your version:

&gt
&gt so, there is my question. how to read the open source with LispWorks.
&gt from example: how to jump to the define, search all reference. and so on. 
&gt
&gt thank you.
