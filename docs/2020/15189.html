                <h1>REPL delay when SLIME is connected to LW GUI</h1>
                <pre>I'm connecting my Emacs to a running LW GUI via SLIME.

There's a VERY noticeable delay when evaluating commands at the SLIME REPL prompt.

Does anyone know how to fix this?

    Thank you, Joel

I've had the same problem for some time. I tried building an image in which the GUI environment is not started, then starting up the GUI environment when I needed it. SLIME seems to work fine until I start the environment, whereupon the long eval delays reappear.

I hope your issue remains gone, but that you also figure out how you accomplished it. I would prefer to use SLIME, but I've basically given it up when working with GUI code because the long eval delays make it more or less unusable.

I run (swank-server) from the GUI prompt and it just works.

                 <pre>Seems to be working, so far. I vaguely remember that some time in the past I tried the same setup and it eventually stopped working well, but that may be my unreliable memory fooling me.

Anyway, so far, so good. Thanks!
