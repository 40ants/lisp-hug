                 <h1>Re: Tail Call Optimization Troubles Ahead?</h1>
                 <pre>&gt CET introduces changes in the CPU that create a new stack called the
&gt control stack. This stack cant be modified by attackers and doesnt
&gt store any data. It stores the return addresses of the Lego bricks that
&gt are already in the stack. Because of this, even if an attacker has
&gt corrupted a return address in the data stack, the control stack
&gt retains the correct return address. The processor can detect this and
&gt halt execution.
I assume that compilers will need to use that feature explicitly in
order to benefit from that, meaning that they will need to opt in for
using the new immutable control stack for their returns.

This is because I think that the last thing Intel wants is breaking
backwards compatibility with already existing and working software that
uses mutable stacks (which is, like, 99% of contemporary x86 software?),
since breaking backwards compatibility like that would be an endless
source of bug reports for them. x86_64 is famous for being backwards
compatible with 16-bit DOS, after all.

So, to use Betteridge's law of headlines: no, I don't think it'll be
much of an issue.

                 <pre>I'm a little concerned about it, in that it might make it much harder to 
inter-operate between more dynamic languages (such as Lisp) and more 
static ones (such as C). It's all very well turning it off in Lisp 
world, but how are we supposed to build a shared library that can be 
called from C?

These days I work (in C) in low-level tools development for HPC Linux 
clusters. This technology will stop us from doing some things when it's 
turned on (such as correctly wrapping a dlopen() call in an LD_PRELOAD 
library, details on request), so there's widespread interest tempered 
with a certain level of scepticism that people will ever turn it on.

                 <pre>Correct, it will be difficult in a place where we need to add FFI into
the mix; I would imagine that such kind of mitigation would need to be
taken into account either when linking against code that is compiled
with such stacks, unless the OS finds out a way to enable such
mitigations for whole individual processes.

(That said, and going slightly off-topic, I imagine that some
paranoia-oriented operating systems, such as OpenBSD, will be the first
to compile and run everything they can with such a technology enabled.)
UNIX and Lisp are two completely distinct worlds, and I imagine that
such a mitigation technique would be most useful for the former,
memory-unsafe world.

But then again, I'll share an optimistic point of view; in case this
technology is deployed, I imagine that Lisp won't be the only dynamic
language that will need to figure out a way of linking dynamic code
against static code with a separate, immutable control stack. If Python
and Ruby find a way, so will Lisp.
