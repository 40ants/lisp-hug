                <h1>[CAPI] Sliders controlled by keys</h1>
                <pre>
  Hello,

I have a couple of sliders (on Cocoa) with somewhat large ranges, and
the mouse only gives so much precision. I'd like to additionally control
them with keys, e.g., left and right arrows, to decf and incf their
value respectively.

I've read the documentation on input models, but unfortunately, it seems
that sliders don't have an :input-model... Any ideas ?

Thanks !

&gt I'd like to additionally control them with keys, e.g., left and right arrows,
&gt to decf and incf their value respectively.

I don’t know about other platforms, but at least on cocoa, capi:slider are indeed controllable by the arrow keys by default! You can’t set a specific step size just for the arrow keys though, is that what you wanted?

  Hmm. All right. This may be a focus problem then. In fact, I never
  payed attention to this until now. When the interface starts, I see
  that the first radio button at the top left appears to be selected
  (I've read this somewhere in the documentation indeed), but then,
  clicking anywhere else doesn't seem to move the focus.

  In fact, even within the first radio buttons pane, I can't seem to
  find a way to check another option with the keyboard. The only key
  that works is the space bar, which just reselects the already selected
  button.

  So I guess the question is: is there a simple way to install an
  application-wide "standard" interface control from the keyboard, or do
  I need to program everything myself (focus, gesture, whatever else)?

                 <pre>Make sure you haven’t specified :accepts-focus-p nil for the sliders.

Doesn’t the TAB key work?

Running the following code, I can walk between the checkboxes with TAB:
(capi:contain (make-instance 'capi:check-button-panel :layout-class 'capi:column-layout :items '(1 2 3)))

However I can’t check the selected box with Space, so that I would consider a bug.

  Same here.

Perhaps I should mention now that I'm running LW Personal 6.1.1 on High
Sierra 10.13.6.

Ah, that may explain the differences: I’m on LW 7.1.2. Same version of macOS as you (10.13.6).

In my experience, the ”focus ring” generally works well in CAPI, although it is at times annoying that you cannot set the tab order explicitly.

As for the sliders, I implemented my own slider component, mostly to be able to customize the graphical appearance, but that also enables me to do various stuff such as logarithmic value ranges, resetting to default value on alt-click (which is common for faders in DAWs) etc. So that could still be one way to go.
