                <h1>ASDF weirdness</h1>
                <pre>For some reason I have lost track of I decided I should make things so that various of my packages can use ASDF.  I'm using 64-bit LW 7.1.1 on OSX.  I think I'm using the bundled ASDF, but I might have updated it.  ASDF reports itself as being 3.3.0.

To configure the source registry system I have this form:

(asdf:initialize-source-registry
 '(:source-registry
   :inherit-configuration
   (:tree
    (:root "Local" "tfb" "packages" "asdf"))))

I know this is not how you are meant to do that, but it means I can have the configuration in a single file which I control with git rather than some obscure config file which I have no idea where it is, and I can put my packages in "/Local/tfb/packages/asdf/...".

And this works fine:

&gt (asdf:locate-system "org.tfeb.hax")
t
nil
#P"/Local/tfb/packages/asdf/org.tfeb.hax/org.tfeb.hax.asd"
nil
nil

All is shiny and good.

Except ... not.  This is great in the LW GUI, but I also have console images which are made by

&lt;lispworks-binary&gt -build make-console-image.lisp

Where make-console-image.lisp is:

(in-package :cl-user)

;;; This is not needed, but harmless
(load-all-patches)

(save-image "lw"
            :clean-down t
            :console t
            :environment nil)
(quit)

And in these images nothing works:

CL-USER 1 &gt (asdf:locate-system "org.tfeb.hax")
nil
nil
nil
nil
nil

CL-USER 2 &gt asdf:*source-registry-parameter*
(:source-registry
 :inherit-configuration
 (:tree (:root "Local" "tfb" "packages" "asdf")))

As you can see the console image has read the init file.  I've also tried explicitly clearing the registry and redefining it.  No good.

Does anyone understand ASDF well enough to explain what's going on?  Every time I try and understand it it just fills me with depression and I end up using LW's defsystem and/or writing another makefile because it's easier, but I also realise that I kind of need to have a defsystem I can use on platforms other than LW if I want to make any of my code available to people.

Just knowing what function I should trace or hook I should set to tell ASDF to show me where it's looking would be good.

Thanks

Thanks, this is it.  The LW GUI starts up in / (which is kind of annoying: I think I'd rather it started up in the user's home directory, but there's clearly not really any good choice) while a console image has a good idea of where it is, and this caused the search to be silently wrong.

And this as because I was confused about what :root is meant to do: I'd naively assumed it meant, well, the root directory.  But it doesn't:

  :ROOT
    ;; magic, for output-translations source only: paths that are relative
    ;; to the root of the source host and device

It means the root directory but only in some cases, and not in this case when it means, I think, nothing.

I've since also discovered that find-system doesn't actually search for systems as best I can see: that search happens when the source registry is defined.  So if you define the source registry at image start time, and there's a big tree to search, the image is slow to start: on my machine

  (initialize-source-registry
   '(:source-registry
     :inherit-configuration
     (:tree "/Local")))

makes the image take a great chunk of a minute to start (well, the first time: once the filesystem cache is warm it's better).

Well, OK, I'm going to revive my antique hack which knew how to search for things based on their names and modify it so it will look for asd files, and make sure that that tree is not where ASDF searches by default so my images start quickly.

However, thanks: this has solved it.

<p dir="auto">Yes, that was done by Faré a long time ago.  I believe that this was done to handle very large lisp systems like the ones that ITA was building, but you are right that it doesn't make a great tradeoff for people with more modest systems.</p>

<p dir="auto">Yes, ASDF does now lock you into eagerly finding systems, rather than lazily finding them, <em>unless</em> you use <code style="background-color:#F7F7F7; border-radius:3px; margin:0; padding:0 0.4em" bgcolor="#F7F7F7">asdf:*central-registry*</code>, but if you do that, you can find things lazily.</p>

<p dir="auto">The docs encourage you to use the new shiny thing, but <code style="background-color:#F7F7F7; border-radius:3px; margin:0; padding:0 0.4em" bgcolor="#F7F7F7">*central-registry*</code> is simple and has worked for me forever.</p>
